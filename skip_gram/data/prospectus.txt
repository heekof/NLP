IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
  _____________________________________________________________________________ 
THIS DOCUMENT IS IMPORTANT. BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ANY OF THE SHARES YOU 
SHOULD ENSURE THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF SUCH AN 
INVESTMENT, THE RISKS INVOLVED AND YOUR OWN PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IF 
YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THIS PROSPECTUS YOU SHOULD 
 TAKE ADVICE FROM AN APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED ADVISOR. 
 Authorisation 
The Company is an investment company with variable capital incorporated on 17 September 2007 
and authorised in Luxembourg as an undertaking for collective investment pursuant to Part I of the 
amended law of 17 December 2010 relating to undertakings for collective investment, as amended 
(the “Law”). The Company qualifies as an undertaking for collective investment in transferable 
Securities (“UCITS”) under article 1(2) of the Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions 
relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (the “UCITS Directive”) 
and may therefore be offered for sale in each member state of the European Union (“EU Member 
 State”), subject to registration. 
This authorisation however, does not constitute a warranty by the Authority as to the performance 
of the Company and the Authority shall not be liable for the performance or default of the Company. 
Authorisation of the Company is not an endorsement or guarantee of the Company by the Authority 
nor is the Authority responsible for the contents of this Prospectus. Any representation to the 
  contrary is unauthorised and unlawful. 
The Company is structured as an open-ended umbrella fund with segregated liability between 
Funds. Shares representing interests in different Funds may be issued from time to time by the 
Directors. Shares of more than one Class may be issued in relation to a Fund. All Shares of each 
Class will rank pari passu save as provided for in the relevant Supplement. On the introduction of 
any new Fund or any new Class of Shares (for which prior Authority approval is required), the 
Company will prepare and the Directors will issue a Supplement setting out the relevant details of 
each such Fund or new Class of Shares. A separate portfolio of assets will be maintained for each 
Fund (and accordingly not for each Class of Shares) and will be invested in accordance with the 
investment objective and policy applicable to such Fund. Particulars relating to individual Funds 
 and the Classes of Shares available therein are set out in the relevant Supplement. 
The Company has segregated liability between its Funds and accordingly any liability incurred on 
 behalf of or attributable to any Fund shall be discharged solely out of the assets of that Fund. 
 Responsibility 
The Directors (whose names appear under the heading “Management of the Company – Directors 
of the Company” below), accept responsibility for the information contained in this Prospectus and 
each relevant Supplement. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the Directors (who have 
taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this 
Prospectus (as complemented, modified or supplemented by the relevant Supplement), when read 
together with the relevant Supplement, is in accordance with the facts as at the date of the relevant 
   Supplement and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.

 Listing on a stock exchange 
Application may be made to (i) the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (including Bourse de Luxembourg 
and Euro MTF), (ii) the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, (iii) the Stuttgart Stock Exchange for the listing 
of Shares of any Class issued and available for issue and/or any other stock exchange as 
determined by the board of directors of the Company. Notwithstanding any application to list such 
 Shares, it is not anticipated that an active secondary market will develop in such Shares. 
Neither the admission of Shares of any Class in the Company to a stock exchange nor the 
approval of this Prospectus pursuant to the listing requirements of such stock exchange 
shall constitute a warranty or representation by the stock exchange as to the competence 
of service providers to or any other party connected with the Company, the adequacy of 
information contained in this Prospectus or the suitability of the Company for investment 
 or for any other purposes. 
 Data Protection 
In accordance with the provisions of the applicable Luxembourg data protection law, and with the 
Regulation n°2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and any other data protection 
law applicable in Luxembourg (“Data Protection Law”), the Company acting as data controller (the 
“Data Controller”) collects stores and processes, by electronic or other means, the personal data 
supplied by the investors and prospective investors (the “Data Subjects”), at the pre-contractual 
stage, at the time of subscription or on an ongoing basis, for the purpose of fulfilling the services 
 required by the investors and complying with the Company’s legal obligations.  
The data processed includes the name, contact details (including postal and/or e-mail address), 
banking details and the invested amount of the Data Subject (and, if the Data Subject is a legal 
person, of any natural person related to the Data Subject such as its nominee(s), representative(s), 
 employee(s), contact person(s) and/or beneficial owner(s)) (the “Personal Data”).  
The Data Subject may, at his/her/its discretion, refuse to communicate the Personal Data to the 
Data Controller. In this case however, the Data Controller may refuse to admit the Data Subject to 
 the Company. 
Personal Data supplied by the Data Subjects is processed in order to enter into and perform the 
subscription of shares in the Company, for the legitimate interests of the Data Controller and to 
comply with the legal obligations imposed on the Data Controller. In particular, the Personal Data 
supplied by the Data Subjects is processed for the purposes of (i) processing subscriptions, 
transfers, capital calls and distributions to investors/Shareholders (ii) maintaining the register of 
Shareholders, (iii) processing investments and withdrawals of and payments of dividends to the 
Shareholders, (iv) account administration; (v) complying with applicable anti-money laundering 
rules and other legal obligations, such as maintaining controls in respect of CRS/FATCA obligations 
and (vi) group risk management and risk controlling purposes. In addition, Personal Data may be 
processed for the purposes of commercial prospection. Each Data Subject has the right to object 
to the use of his/her/its Personal Data for commercial prospection purposes by writing to the Data 
 Controller.  
The “legitimate interests” referred to above are: 
• 
the processing purposes described in points (i) to (vi) of the above paragraph of this data 
protection section; 
• 
meeting and complying with the Company’s accountability requirements and regulatory 
obligations globally; and  
• 
exercising the business of the Company in accordance with reasonable market standards.  
 

 <Page4>

The Personal Data may also be processed by the Data Controller’s data recipients (the 
“Recipients”) which, in the context of the above mentioned purposes, refer to the Management 
Company, the Investment Manager, the Distributor, the Depositary and Paying Agent, the 
Administrator, Registrar, Domiciliary and Transfer Agent, the Auditors and the Legal Advisor(s). 
The Recipients may, under their own responsibility, disclose the Personal Data to their agents 
and/or delegates (the “Sub-Recipients”), which shall process the Personal Data for the sole 
purposes of assisting the Recipients in providing their services to the Data Controller and/or 
assisting the Recipients in fulfilling their own legal obligations. The Recipients and Sub-Recipients 
may be located either in or outside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where the Recipients 
and/or Sub-Recipients are located outside the EEA in a country which does not ensure an adequate 
level of protection for Personal Data and does not beneficiate from an adequacy decision of the 
European Commission, the Data Controller has entered into legally binding transfer agreements 
with the relevant Recipients in the form of the EU Commission approved model clauses (the “Model 
Clauses”). In this respect, the Data Subjects have a right to request copies of the relevant 
document for enabling the Personal Data transfer(s) towards such countries by writing to the Data 
Controller. The Recipients and Sub-Recipients may, as the case may be, process the Personal 
Data as data processors (when processing the Personal Data upon instructions of the Data 
Controller), or as distinct data controllers (when processing the Personal Data for their own 
purposes, namely fulfilling their own legal obligations). The Data Controller may also transfer 
Personal Data to third-parties such as governmental or regulatory agencies, including tax 
authorities, in or outside the European Union, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
In particular, such Personal Data may be disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authorities, which in turn 
 may acting as data controller, disclose the same to foreign tax authorities. 
In accordance with the conditions laid down by the Data Protection Law, the Data Subjects 
acknowledge their rights to: 
• 
access their Personal Data (i.e. the right to obtain from the Data Controller confirmation 
as to whether or not Data Subject’s Personal Data are being processed, to be provided 
with certain information about the Data Controller’s processing of their Personal Data, to 
access to that data, and to obtain a copy of the Personal data undergoing processing 
(subject to exceptions));  
• 
correct their Personal Data where it is inaccurate or incomplete (i.e. the right to require 
from the Data Controller that inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data be updated or 
corrected accordingly); 
• 
restrict the use of their Personal data (i.e. the right to obtain that, under certain 
circumstances, the processing of the Data Subject’s Personal Data should be restricted 
to storage of such data unless his/her consent has been obtained); 
• 
object to the processing of their Personal Data (i.e. the right to object, on grounds relating 
to the Data Subject’s particular situation, to processing of Personal Data which is based 
on the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the legitimate interests 
of the Data Controller. The Data Controller shall stop such processing unless it can either 
demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the Data 
Subject’s interests, rights and freedoms or that it needs to process the data for the 
establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims); 
• 
ask for erasure of their Personal Data (i.e. the right to require that Personal Data be 
erased in certain circumstances, including where it is no longer necessary for the Data 
Controller to process this data in relation to the purposes for which it collected or 
processed);  
• 
ask for Personal Data portability (i.e. the right to have the data transferred to the Data 
Subjects or another controller in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable 
format, where this is technically feasible).  
 
The Data Subjects may exercise the above rights by writing to the Data Controller at the following 
 address: 10, rue du Château d’Eau, L-3364 Leudelange, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. 
The Data Subjects also acknowledge the existence of their right to lodge a complaint with the 

 <Page5>

National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) at the following address: 15, Boulevard du 
Jazz, L-4370 Belvaux, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, or with any other competent data protection 
 supervisory authority of their EU Member State of residence. 
The Personal Data shall not be held by the Data Controller for longer than necessary with regard 
 to the purpose of the data processing, subject to any limitation periods provided by law.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
This section is a brief overview of certain of the important information set out in this Prospectus. It 
is not a complete description of all of the important information to be considered in connection with 
an investment in the Shares of a Fund and should be read in conjunction with, and is subject to the 
full provisions set out in this Prospectus and the Supplement relating to the relevant Shares of the 
 Fund. 
Company 
The Company is an investment company with variable capital incorporated 
on 17 September 2007 and authorised in Luxembourg as UCITS. 
 
Funds 
The Company is structured as an open-ended umbrella fund in that Shares 
representing interests in different Funds may be issued from time to time by 
the Directors. Shares of more than one Class may be issued in relation to a 
Fund. All Shares of each Class will rank pari passu save as provided for in 
the relevant Supplement. On the introduction of any new Fund or any new 
Class of Shares (for which the prior approval of the Authority is required), the 
Management Company will prepare and issue a Supplement setting out the 
relevant details of each such Fund or new Class of Shares. A separate 
portfolio of assets will be maintained for each Fund (and accordingly not for 
each Class of Shares) and will be invested in accordance with the investment 
objective and policies applicable to such Fund. Particulars relating to 
individual Funds and the Classes of Shares available therein are set out in 
the relevant Supplement. 
Investment 
Objective  
and Policies 
The Fund may follow any of the investment objectives below or a combination 
 of them. 
 Funds whose performance is linked to an Underlying 
The investment objective of such Funds is to provide the investors with a 
return (either at the Scheduled Maturity Date or on each Dealing Day) linked 
 to an Underlying (as is defined in the relevant Supplement). 
In order to achieve the investment objective, the Shareholders of a Fund will 
 be exposed to the performance of the Underlying. 
Such Funds will generally not invest directly (and/or fully) in the Underlying. 
These Funds will instead invest a substantial majority of the net proceeds of 
any issue of Shares (whether on the relevant Launch Date or subsequently) 
in (i) transferable securities in accordance with the Investment Restrictions 
and will exchange all or part of the performance of such transferable 
securities against the performance of the Underlying through an Asset Swap, 
or (ii) in a Funded Swap in accordance with the Investment Restrictions to 
gain an exposure to the performance of the Underlying. The Fund will reduce 
its risk to an Approved Counterparty by having such Approved Counterparty 
deliver collateral in accordance with the Investment Restrictions. The 
collateral is enforceable by the Company at all times and will be marked to 
market daily. The Company may enter into repurchase (repo) transactions 
with respect to any Fund Assets. Any such repo transaction will be 
  undertaken in compliance with the requirements of the Authority. 

 <Page21>  
 
21 
 
The return that the Shareholder will receive will be dependent on the 
performance of the Fund Assets, the performance of the Underlying and the 
performance of any techniques used to link the Fund Assets to the Underlying 
and thus the return Shareholders receive may not wholly correspond to the 
performance of the Underlying. There is no assurance that the investment 
objective of any Fund whose performance is linked to the Underlying 
 will actually be achieved. 
The Underlying may have an Index Sponsor or other agents where the 
Underlying consists of an Index. The existence of such Index Sponsor and/or 
 agents will be specified in the relevant Supplement. 
The Fund Assets and any techniques used to link the Fund Assets to the 
Underlying will be managed by the Investment Manager. The management 
of the Fund Assets will generally not involve the active buying and selling of 
securities on the basis of investment judgement and economic, financial and 
market analysis. The composition of the Fund Assets will generally be 
determined on or prior to a Fund’s Launch Date and such composition will 
generally not be subject to further major changes subsequent to the Launch 
 Date of the relevant Fund. 
Funds with a Scheduled Maturity Date will follow an investment policy that 
aims at providing investors with predefined distributions, if applicable, and a 
payout upon the Scheduled Maturity Date. The ability to provide investors 
with such a predefined payout is dependent upon a number of parameters, 
including market movements between the determination of the payout upon 
the structuring of the Fund and the Fund’s Launch Date. In order to mitigate 
these market movements which could affect the payout, the Fund may, in 
accordance with the Investment Restrictions, agree to take over pre-hedging 
arrangements (if any) that an Approved Counterparty may have entered into. 
The Fund will bear the costs and expenses relating to such pre-hedging 
 arrangements. 
 Funds replicating the performance of an Underlying 
The investment objective of this category of Funds is to aim to replicate the 
performance of an Underlying (as is defined in the relevant Supplement) 
 which could be a financial index. 
Each Fund aims to replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of 
the Underlying by holding a portfolio of transferable securities or other eligible 
assets in accordance with Investment Restrictions that comprises all or 
substantially all of the Underlying Constituents. Accordingly, each Fund is not 
managed according to active investment management techniques, but a 
 defined approach is applied to each Fund. 
Each Fund aims to achieve a level of replicating accuracy and minimise the 
annual difference in returns, before fees, administration, trading, dealing, and 
bid/offer expenses, between the performance of the Fund’s Shares and that 
Fund’s Underlying. However, exceptional circumstances, such as, but not 
limited to, disruptive market conditions or extremely volatile markets, may 
arise which cause such a Fund's replicating accuracy to diverge substantially 
from the Underlying. Additionally, in relation to certain Funds and the 
composition of each of their Underlyings, it may not be practicably possible, 
for example because of the Investment Restrictions, liquidity or trading 
constraints, to achieve such a level of replicating accuracy. 

 <Page22>  
 
22 
 
Each Fund will generally invest in the Underlying Constituents of its 
Underlying in proportion to their weighting in the Underlying and will, subject 
to the concentration limits discussed below, normally aim to invest a 
substantial part of its total assets in the Underlying Constituents. Each Fund 
of this category may hold transferable securities or other eligible assets 
replicating the Underlying in accordance with the Investment Restrictions. 
Such transferable securities or other financial instruments may be issued by 
Barclays Bank PLC or an Affiliate. Such transferable securities or other 
 financial instruments will allow a more practicable management of the Fund. 
Due to various factors, including the Fund’s fees and expenses involved, the 
concentration limits described in the Investment Restrictions, other legal or 
regulatory restrictions, and, in certain instances, certain Underlying 
Constituents being illiquid, it may not be possible or practicable to purchase 
all of the Underlying Constituents in their weightings or purchase certain of 
them at all. Investors should consult the “Risk Factors” below. There is no 
assurance that the investment objective of any Fund replicating the 
performance of the Underlying will actually be achieved. 
 
Classes of 
Shares 
The Directors may decide to create within each Fund different Classes of 
Shares. All Classes of Shares relating to the same Fund will be commonly 
invested in accordance with such Fund’s investment objective but may differ 
with regard to their fee structure, Minimum Initial Investment Amount, Minimal 
Additional 
Investment 
Amount, 
Minimum 
Shareholding, 
Minimum 
Repurchase Amount, dividend policy (including the dates and payments of 
any dividends), investor eligibility criteria or other particular feature(s) as the 
Directors will decide. A separate Net Asset Value per Share will be calculated 
for each issued Class of Shares in relation to each Fund. The different 
features of each Class of Shares available relating to a Fund are described 
 in detail in the relevant Supplement. 
The Company reserves the right to offer only one or several Classes of 
Shares for purchase by investors in any particular jurisdiction in order to 
conform to local law, custom or business practice. The Company also 
reserves the right to adopt standards applicable to certain classes of investors 
or transactions in respect of the purchase of a particular Class of Shares. 
 
Dividend 
Policy 
The Directors decide the dividend policy and arrangements relating to each 
Fund and details are set out where applicable in the relevant Supplement. 
Under the Articles, the Directors are entitled to declare dividends out of the 
relevant Fund being: (i) the accumulated revenue (consisting of all revenue 
accrued including interest and dividends) less expenses and/or (ii) realised 
and unrealised capital gains on the disposal/valuation of investments and 
other funds less realised and unrealised accumulated capital losses of the 
relevant Fund and/or (iii) the capital of the relevant Fund. The Directors may 
satisfy any dividend due to Shareholders in whole or in part by distributing to 
them in specie any of the assets of the relevant Fund, and in particular any 
investments to which the relevant Fund is entitled. A Shareholder may require 
the Company instead of transferring any assets in specie to him, to arrange 
for a sale of the assets and for payment to the Shareholder of the net 
proceeds of same. 
 
Risk Factors 
An investment in a Fund involves a number of risks, including a possible loss 
of the amount invested. Moreover, there can be no guarantee or assurance 

 <Page23>  
 
23 
 
that a Fund will achieve its investment objective. A more detailed description 
of certain risk factors relevant to investors in the Funds is set out under “Risk 
Factors” and the appropriate section within the Supplement describing certain 
risk factors associated with each Fund. 
 
Subscription 
of Shares 
Shares will be offered for subscription during the Initial Offer Period at the 
Initial Issue Price plus the Preliminary Charge (if applicable) as described in 
“Subscription for Shares”. Subsequent subscriptions will be made at the Net 
Asset Value per Share of the relevant Class plus the Preliminary Charge (if 
applicable) as described in “Subscription for Shares”. 
 
Repurchase 
of Shares 
Shares will be repurchased at the applicable Net Asset Value per Share of 
the relevant Class minus the Repurchase Charge (if applicable) as described 
in “Repurchase of Shares” or in the relevant Supplement. 
 
Exchanges 
of Shares 
Exchanges of Shares of any Class of any Fund may be made into Shares of 
another Class which are being offered at that time (such Class being of the 
same Fund or different Fund) to the extent authorised in the Supplement and 
as described under “Exchange of Shares”. 
 
Dealing Fees 
(a) 
Preliminary Charge 
 
Shares may be subject to a Preliminary Charge which will be calculated on 
the Initial Issue Price or the Net Asset Value per Share as described under 
“Share Dealings – Subscription for Shares – Subscription Price”, as is 
 specified in the Supplement for the relevant Fund. 
(b) 
Repurchase Charge 
 
Shares may be subject to a Repurchase Charge which will be calculated on 
the Net Asset Value per Share as described under “Share Dealings – 
Repurchase of Shares – Repurchase Price”, as is specified in the 
 Supplement for the relevant Fund. 
(c) 
Exchange Charge 
 
An Exchange Charge of up to 2% of the Repurchase Price of the Shares 
being exchanged may be charged by the Company on the exchange of 
 Shares, as is specified in the Supplement for the relevant Fund. 
(d) 
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC) 
 
A CDSC of up to 4% of the Repurchase Price of Shares (depending on when 
the investor enters and exits the relevant Fund) being redeemed may be 
charged by the Company on the redemption of Shares, as is specified in the 
Supplement for the relevant Fund. Where a CDSC is charged, no Preliminary 
Charge will be payable on subscription for Shares in the relevant Fund. 
 
Other 
Fees 
and 
Expenses 
Information on fees and expenses for each Fund can be found under the 
heading “Fees and Expenses” of this Prospectus and the relevant 
  Supplement.

 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
FUNDS 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
The Company has segregated liability between its Funds and accordingly any liability incurred on 
 behalf of or attributable to any Fund shall be discharged solely out of the assets of that Fund. 
 Funds 
The Company has adopted an “umbrella” structure to provide both Institutional Investors and Retail 
Investors with a choice of different Funds. Each Fund will be differentiated by its specific investment 
objective, policy, currency of denomination or other specific features as described in the relevant 
Supplement. A separate pool of assets is maintained for each Fund and is invested in accordance 
 with each Fund’s respective investment objective. 
 Typology of risk profiles 
Unless otherwise specified in the relevant Supplement, the Funds are available for investment by 
Institutional and Retail Investors. The Funds are however complex products where typical investors 
are expected to be informed investors and to especially have a good knowledge of derivatives 
instruments. Generally speaking, typical investors are expected to be willing to adopt capital and 
 income risk. 
Additional information on the risk profile of every Fund is specified in the Supplement of the 
 relevant Fund. 
If you are in any doubt as to the level of risk that you should take, you should seek independent 
 advice from your personal investment adviser. 
 Classes of Shares 
The Directors may decide to create within each Fund different Classes of Shares. All Classes of 
Shares relating to the same Fund will be commonly invested in accordance with such Fund’s 
investment objective but may differ with regard to their fee structure, Minimum Initial Investment 
Amount, Minimal Additional Investment Amount, Minimum Shareholding, Minimum Repurchase 
Amount, dividend policy (including the dates and payments of any dividends), investor eligibility 
criteria or other particular feature(s) as the Directors will decide. A separate Net Asset Value per 
Share will be calculated for each issued Class of Shares in relation to each Fund. The different 
features of each Class of Shares available relating to a Fund are described in detail in the relevant 
 Supplement. 
The Company reserves the right to offer only one or several Classes of Shares for purchase by 
investors in any particular jurisdiction in order to conform to local law, custom or business practice. 
The Company also reserves the right to adopt standards applicable to certain classes of investors 
 or transactions in respect of the purchase of a particular Class of Shares. 
 Investment Objective and Policies 
The Articles provide that the investment objective and policy for each Fund will be formulated by 
the Directors at the time of the creation of that Fund. Details of the investment objective and policy 
for each Fund of the Company appear in the Supplement and key investor information documents 
 for the relevant Fund. 
In the event of a change of investment objective and/or policy of a Fund, a reasonable notification 
period of at least one month must be given to each Shareholder of the Fund to enable a Shareholder 

 <Page26>  
 
26 
 
to have all or part of its Shares repurchased prior to the implementation of such change free of any 
 charges. 
 The Fund may follow any of the investment objectives below or a combination of them. 
 Funds whose performance is linked to an Underlying 
The investment objective of such Funds is to provide the investors with a return (either at the 
Scheduled Maturity Date or on each Dealing Day) linked to an Underlying (as is defined in the 
 relevant Supplement). 
In order to achieve the investment objective, the Shareholders of a Fund will be exposed to the 
 performance of the Underlying. 
Such Funds will generally not invest directly (and/or fully) in the Underlying. These Funds will 
instead invest a substantial majority of the net proceeds of any issue of Shares (whether on the 
relevant Launch Date or subsequently) in (i) transferable securities in accordance with the 
Investment Restrictions and will exchange all or part of the performance and/or income of such 
transferable securities, or (ii) in a FDI in accordance with the Investment Restrictions to reflect the 
performance of the Underlying. The Fund will reduce its risk to an Approved Counterparty by having 
such Approved Counterparty deliver collateral in accordance with the Investment Restrictions. The 
collateral is enforceable by the Company at all times and will be marked to market daily. The 
Company may enter into repurchase (repo) transactions with respect to any Fund Asset. Any such 
 repo transaction will be undertaken in compliance with the requirements of the Authority. 
The return that the Shareholder will receive will be dependent on the performance of the Fund 
Assets, the performance of the Underlying and the performance of any techniques used to link the 
Fund Assets to the Underlying and thus the return Shareholders receive may not wholly correspond 
to the performance of the Underlying. There is no assurance that the investment objective of 
 any Fund whose performance is linked to the Underlying will actually be achieved. 
The Underlying may have an Index Sponsor or other agents where the Underlying consists of an 
Index. The existence of such Index Sponsor and/or agents will be specified in the relevant 
 Supplement. 
The Fund Assets and any techniques used to link the Fund Assets to the Underlying will be 
managed by the Investment Manager. The management of the Fund Assets will generally not 
involve the active buying and selling of securities on the basis of investment judgement and 
economic, financial and market analysis. The composition of the Fund Assets will generally be 
determined on or prior to a Fund’s Launch Date and such composition will generally not be subject 
 to further major changes subsequent to the Launch Date of the relevant Fund. 
Funds with a Scheduled Maturity Date will follow an investment policy that aims at providing 
investors with predefined distributions, if applicable, and a payout upon the Scheduled Maturity 
Date. The ability to provide investors with such a predefined payout is dependent upon a number 
of parameters, including market movements between the determination of the payout upon the 
structuring of the Fund and the Fund’s Launch Date. In order to mitigate these market movements 
which could affect the payout, the Fund may, in accordance with the Investment Restrictions, agree 
to take over pre-hedging arrangements (if any) that the Approved Counterparty may have entered 
 into. The Fund will bear the costs and expenses relating to such pre-hedging arrangements. 
 Funds replicating the performance of an Underlying 
The investment objective of this category of Funds is to aim to replicate the performance of an 
 Underlying (as is defined in the relevant Supplement). 

 <Page27>  
 
27 
 
Each Fund aims to replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of an Underlying by 
holding a portfolio of transferable securities or other eligible assets in accordance with the 
Investment Restrictions that comprises all or substantially all of the Underlying Constituents. 
Accordingly, each Fund is not managed according to active investment management techniques, 
 but a defined approach is applied to each Fund. 
Each Fund aims to achieve a level of replicating accuracy and minimise the annual difference in 
returns, before fees, administration, trading, dealing and bid/offer expenses, between the 
performance of the Fund’s Shares and that Fund’s Underlying. However, exceptional 
circumstances, such as, but not limited to, disruptive market conditions or extremely volatile 
markets, may arise which cause such a Fund's replicating accuracy to diverge substantially from 
the Underlying. Additionally, in relation to certain Funds and the composition of each of their 
Underlyings, it may not be practicably possible, for example because of the Investment Restrictions, 
 liquidity or trading constraints, to achieve such a level of replicating accuracy. 
Each Fund will generally invest in the Underlying Constituents of its Underlying in proportion to their 
weighting in the Underlying and will, subject to the concentration limits discussed below, normally 
aim to invest a substantial part of its total assets in the Underlying Constituents. Each Fund of this 
category may hold transferable securities or other eligible assets replicating the Underlying in 
accordance with the Investment Restrictions. Such transferable securities or other financial 
instruments may be issued by Barclays Bank PLC or an Affiliate. Such transferable securities or 
 other financial instruments will allow a more practicable management of the Fund. 
Due to various factors, including the Fund’s fees and expenses involved, the concentration limits 
described in the Investment Restrictions, other legal or regulatory restrictions, and, in certain 
instances, certain Underlying Constituents being illiquid, it may not be possible or practicable to 
purchase all of the Underlying Constituents in their weightings or purchase certain of them at all. 
Investors should consult the “Risk Factors” below. There is no assurance that the investment 
 objective of any Fund replicating the performance of the Underlying will actually be achieved. 
The Underlying may have an Index Sponsor or other agents where the Underlying consists of an 
Index. The existence of such Index Sponsor and/or agents will be specified in the relevant 
 Supplement. 
 Investment Restrictions 
The investment restrictions applying to each Fund of the Company under the Regulations are set 
out below. These are, however, subject to the qualifications and exemptions contained in the 
Regulations. Any additional investment restrictions for other Funds will be formulated by the 
 Directors at the time of the creation of such Fund. 
To the extent permitted by the Regulations, the Directors may from time to time impose such further 
investment restrictions as shall be compatible with or in the interest of the Shareholders, in order 
 to comply with the laws and regulations of the countries where Shareholders are placed. 
Any amendments to the investment restrictions which relate to a particular Fund will be disclosed 
 in the relevant Supplement to this Prospectus.

companies which includes one or several listed companies, is 
dedicated to the financing of the group or (iii) is an entity which is 
dedicated to the financing of securitisation vehicles which benefit from 
a banking liquidity line. 
1.2. Contrary to the investment restrictions laid down in paragraph 1.1 above, each Fund may: 
(a) 
invest up to 10% of its net assets in transferable securities and Money 
Market Instruments other than those referred to under paragraph 1.1 above; 
and 
(b) 
hold liquid assets on an ancillary basis. Money Market Instruments held as 
ancillary liquid assets may not have a maturity exceeding 12 months. 
The Company may also acquire movable and immovable property which is 
essential for the direct pursuit of its business. 
 
 

 <Page30>  
 
30 
 
2. Risk Diversification 
 
2.1. In accordance with the principle of risk diversification, the Company is not permitted to 
invest more than 10% of the net assets of a Fund in transferable securities or Money 
Market Instruments of one and the same issuer. The total value of the transferable 
securities and Money Market Instruments in each issuer in which more than 5% of the net 
assets of a Fund are invested must not exceed 40% of the value of the net assets of the 
respective Fund. This limitation does not apply to deposits and OTC derivative 
 transactions made with financial institutions subject to prudential supervision. 
2.2. The Company is not permitted to invest more than 20% of the net assets of a Fund in 
deposits made with the same body. 
 
2.3. The risk exposure to an Approved Counterparty of a Fund in an OTC Derivative 
transaction may not exceed: 
− 
10% of its net assets when the an Approved Counterparty is a credit 
institution referred to in paragraph 1.1 f), or 
− 
 5% of its net assets, in other cases. 
2.4. Management of collateral and collateral policy 
In the context of OTC Derivative transactions and efficient portfolio management 
techniques described under paragraph 9 below, the Company may receive collateral 
with a view to reduce its counterparty risk. This section sets out the collateral policy 
applied by the Company in such case. All assets received by the Company in the 
context of efficient portfolio management techniques (securities lending, repurchase 
or reverse repurchase agreements) shall be considered as collateral for the 
 purposes of this section. 
Eligible collateral 
Collateral received by the Company may be used to reduce its counterparty risk 
exposure if it complies with the criteria set out in applicable laws, regulations and 
circulars issued by the Authority from time to time notably in terms of liquidity, 
valuation, issuer credit quality, correlation, risks linked to the management of 
collateral and enforceability. In particular, collateral should comply with the following 
conditions:  
(a) 
any collateral received other than cash should be highly liquid and 
traded on a regulated market or multilateral trading facility with 
transparent pricing in order that it can be sold quickly at a price that 
is close to pre-sale valuation. Collateral received should also comply 
with the provisions of article 48 of the Law (as reproduced below 
under items 6.1. and 6.2.); 
(b) 
it should be valued on at least a daily basis and assets that exhibit 
high price volatility should not be accepted as collateral unless 
suitably conservative haircuts are in place; 
(c) 
collateral received should be of high quality; 
(d) 
it should be issued by an entity that is independent from the 
counterparty and is expected not to display a high correlation with 
the performance of the counterparty; 

 <Page31>  
 
31 
 
(e) 
it should be sufficiently diversified in terms of country, markets and 
issuers. The criterion of sufficient diversification with respect to 
issuer concentration is considered to be respected if a Fund 
receives from a counterparty of efficient portfolio management and 
OTC Derivative transactions a basket of collateral with a maximum 
exposure to a given issuer of 20% of the net asset value of the Fund. 
When a Fund is exposed to different counterparties, the different 
baskets of collateral should be aggregated to calculate the 20% limit 
of exposure to a single issuer. By way of derogation from this sub-
paragraph, a Fund may be fully collateralised in different 
transferable securities and money market instruments issued or 
guaranteed by an EU Member State, one or more of its local 
authorities, a third country, or a public international body to which 
one or more EU Member States belong. Such a Fund should receive 
securities from at least six different issues, but securities from any 
single issue should not account for more than 30% of the net asset 
value of the Fund; 
(f) 
risks linked to the management of collateral, such as operational 
and legal risks, should be identified, managed and mitigated by the 
risk management process of the Company; 
(g) 
where there is a title transfer, the collateral received should be held 
by the Depositary. For other types of collateral arrangement, the 
collateral can be held by a third party custodian which is subject to 
prudential supervision, and which is unrelated to the provider of the 
collateral; 
(h) 
it should be capable of being fully enforced by the Company at any 
time without reference to or approval from the counterparty. 
Subject to the abovementioned conditions and except otherwise disclosed in the 
relevant Supplement, the Funds will usually receive collateral in the form of cash or 
be fully collateralised in government bonds with an average maturity of 0-1 year 
issued or guaranteed by Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States which 
 they are able to accept as collateral for more than 20% of their net asset value. 
Level of collateral 
The Company will determine the required level of collateral for OTC Derivative 
transactions and efficient portfolio management techniques by reference to the 
applicable counterparty risk limits set out in this Prospectus under paragraph 2.3. 
and taking into account the nature and characteristics of transactions, the 
 creditworthiness and identity of counterparties and prevailing market conditions. 
Valuation of collateral 
Collateral will be valued, on a daily basis, using available market prices in 
accordance with the rules set out in this Prospectus as well as a daily variation 
margins, and taking into account appropriate discounts which will be determined by 
the Company for each asset class based on its haircut policy. The policy takes into 
account a variety of factors, depending on the nature of the collateral received, such 
as the issuer’s credit standing, the maturity, currency, price volatility of the assets 
and, where applicable, the outcome of liquidity stress tests carried out by the 
Company under normal and exceptional liquidity conditions. No haircut will generally 
 be applied to cash collateral. 

 <Page32>  
 
32 
 
Except otherwise disclosed in the relevant Supplement, the following haircut policy 
would be applied: 
 
Type of collateral 
Haircut 
Cash 
0% 
Government bonds 
Between 0.25% and 15% (depending on 
issuer and maturity) 
 
Reinvestment of collateral 
Non-cash collateral received by the Company may not be sold, re-invested or 
pledged. 
Cash collateral received by the Company can only be: 
(i) 
placed on deposit with credit institutions which have their registered 
office in an EU Member State or, if their registered office is located 
in a third-country, are subject to prudential rules considered by the 
CSSF as equivalent to those laid down in EU law; 
(j) 
invested in high-quality government bonds; 
(k) 
used for the purpose of reverse repo transactions provided the 
transactions are with credit institutions subject to prudential 
supervision and the Company is able to recall at any time the full 
amount of cash on accrued basis; and/or 
(l) 
invested in short-term money market funds as defined in the 
Guidelines on a Common Definition of European Money Market 
Funds. 
Re-invested cash collateral should be diversified in accordance with the 
diversification requirements applicable to non-cash collateral as set out above.  
A Fund may incur a loss in reinvesting the cash collateral it receives. Such a loss 
may arise due to a decline in the value of the investment made with cash collateral 
received. A decline in the value of such investment of the cash collateral would 
reduce the amount of collateral available to be returned by the Fund to the 
counterparty at the conclusion of the transaction. The Fund would be required to 
cover the difference in value between the collateral originally received and the 
amount available to be returned to the counterparty, thereby resulting in a loss to the 
 Fund. 
Stress testing policy 
For the Funds receiving collateral for at least 30% of their assets, the Company has 
an appropriate stress testing policy in place to ensure regular stress tests are carried 
out under normal and exceptional liquidity conditions to enable the Company to 
assess the liquidity risk attached to the collateral. The liquidity stress testing policy at 
least prescribes the following: 
(m) 
design of stress test scenario analysis including calibration, 
certification & sensitivity analysis; 
(n) 
empirical approach to impact assessment, including back-testing of 
liquidity risk estimates; 
(o) 
reporting frequency and limit/loss tolerance threshold/s; and 

 <Page33>  
 
33 
 
(p) 
mitigation actions to reduce loss including haircut policy and gap 
risk protection. 
Safe-keeping  
Where there is a title transfer, collateral received should be held by the Depositary or 
one of its sub-custodians to which the Depositary has delegated the safe-keeping of 
such collateral. For other types of collateral arrangements, such as security interest 
or pledge, collateral can be held by a third party entity which is subject to prudential 
supervision and which is unrelated to the provider of the collateral.  
2.5. Notwithstanding the individual limits laid down in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, a Fund may 
not combine, where this would lead to investing more than 20% of its net assets in a single 
body, any of the following: 
− 
investments in transferable securities or Money Market Instruments issued 
by that body, 
− 
deposits made with that body, or 
− 
exposures arising from OTC Derivative transactions undertaken with that 
body. 
2.6. The 10% limit set forth in paragraph 2.1 may be of a maximum of 25% for certain bonds 
issued by a credit institutions which has its registered office in an EU Member State and 
is subject by law to special public supervision designed to protect bondholders. In 
particular, sums deriving from the issue of those bonds must be invested, in accordance 
with the law, in assets which, during the whole period of validity of the bonds, are capable 
of covering claims attaching to the bonds and which, in case of bankruptcy of the issuer, 
would be used on a priority basis for the reimbursement of the principal and payment of 
the accrued interest. Furthermore, if investments by a Fund in such bonds with one and 
the same issuer represent more than 5% of the net assets, the total value of these 
 investments may not exceed 80% of the net assets of the corresponding Fund. 
2.7. The 10% limit set forth in paragraph 2.1 may be of a maximum of 35% if the transferable 
securities and Money Market Instruments are issued or guaranteed by an EU Member 
State by its public local authorities, by a non-EU Member State or by public international 
 bodies of which one or more EU Member States belong. 
2.8. Transferable securities and Money Market Instruments which fall under the special ruling 
given in paragraphs 2.6 and 2.7 are not counted when calculating the 40% risk 
 diversification ceiling mentioned in paragraph 2.1. 
2.9. The limits provided for in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.6 may not be combined, and thus 
investments in transferable securities or Money Market Instruments issued by the same 
body or in deposits or derivative instruments made with this body shall under no 
circumstances exceed in total 35% of the net assets of a Fund. 
Companies which are included in the same group for the purposes of consolidated 
accounts, as defined in accordance with Directive 83/349/EEC or in accordance with 
recognised international accounting rules, are regarded as a single body for the purpose 
of calculating the limits contained in this section 2. 
A Fund may cumulatively invest up to a limit of 20% of its net assets in transferable 
securities and Money Market Instruments within the same group. 

 <Page34>  
 
34 
 
 
3. The following exceptions may be made 
 
3.1. Without prejudice to the limits laid down in section 6 the limits laid down in section 2 are 
raised to a maximum of 20% for investment in shares and/or debt securities issued by the 
same body when, according to the constitutional documents of the Company, and the 
relevant Supplement relating to a particular Fund, the Investment Objective of that Fund 
is to replicate the composition of a certain stock or debt securities index which is 
recognised by the Authority, on the following basis: 
− 
the composition of the index is sufficiently diversified, 
− 
the index represents an adequate benchmark for the market to which it 
refers, 
− 
it is published in an appropriate manner. 
The above 20% limit may be raised to a maximum of 35%, but only in respect of a 
single body, where that proves to be justified by exceptional market conditions in 
particular in regulated markets where certain transferable securities or Money Market 
 Instruments are highly dominant. 
3.2. The Company is authorised, in accordance with the principle of risk diversification, to 
invest up to 100% of the net assets of a Fund in transferable securities and Money Market 
Instruments issued or guaranteed by an EU Member State or its local authorities, by a 
non-EU Member State (including the OECD Member States), or by public international 
body to which one or more EU Member States belong. These securities must be divided 
into at least six different issues but securities from any single issue shall not account for 
more than 30% of the total net assets of a Fund. 
 
4. Investment in UCITS and/or other collective investment undertakings 
 
4.1. If a Fund invests in units of other UCITS or collective investment undertakings referred to 
in paragraph 1.1 e) such investment will only be made provided that no more than 20% of 
its net assets are invested in units of a single UCITS or other collective investment 
undertaking. If the UCITS or the other collective investment undertakings have multiple 
compartments and the assets of a compartment may only be used to satisfy the rights of 
the investors relating to that compartment and the rights of those creditors whose claims 
have arisen in connection with the setting-up, operation and liquidation of that 
compartment, each compartment is considered as a separate issuer for the purposes of 
 applying the above limit. 
4.2. Investments made in units of collective investment undertakings other than UCITS may 
 not in any case exceed, in aggregate, 30% of the net assets of the Fund. 
4.3. When a Fund has acquired units of UCITS and/or other collective investment 
undertakings, the assets of the respective UCITS or other collective investment 
undertakings do not have to be combined for the purposes of the limits laid down in section 
 2. 
4.4. When a Fund invests in the units of other UCITS and/or other collective investment 
undertakings that are managed, directly or by delegation, by the same management 

 <Page35>  
 
35 
 
company or by any other company with which the management company is linked by 
common management or control, or by a substantial direct or indirect holding, that 
management company or other company may not charge subscription or redemption fees 
on account of the Fund's investment in the units of such other UCITS and/or collective 
 investment undertakings. 
A Fund that invests a substantial proportion of its assets in other UCITS and/or collective 
investment undertakings shall disclose in its Supplement the maximum level of the 
management fees that may be charged both to the Fund itself and to the other UCITS 
and/or collective investment undertakings in which it intends to invest. In the annual report 
of the Company it shall be indicated for each Fund the maximum proportion of 
management fees charged both to the Fund and to the UCITS and/or other collective 
investment undertaking in which the Fund invests. 
 
5. Tolerances and multiple compartment issuers 
If, because of market movements or the exercising of subscription rights, the limits mentioned 
in this section 1 are exceeded, the Company must have as a priority objective in its sale 
transactions to reduce these positions within the prescribed limits, taking into account the 
best interests of the Shareholders. 
Provided that they continue to observe the principles of diversification, newly established 
Funds may derogate from the limits mentioned under sections 2, 3 and 4 above for a period 
of six months following the date of their authorisation. 
If an issuer of Investment Instruments is a legal entity with multiple compartments and the 
assets of a compartment may only be used to satisfy the rights of the investors relating to 
that compartment and the rights of those creditors whose claims have arisen in connection 
with the setting-up, operation and liquidation of that compartment, each compartment is 
considered as a separate issuer for the purposes of applying the limits set forth under 2, 3.1 
 and 4. 
6. Investment Prohibitions 
 The Company is prohibited from: 
6.1. acquiring shares carrying voting rights which would enable the Company to exercise 
 significant influence over the management of any issuing body; 
6.2. acquiring more than 
− 
10% of the non-voting shares of the same issuer, 
− 
10% of the debt securities of the same issuer, 
− 
25% of the units of the same UCITS or other undertaking for collective 
investment, or 
− 
10% of the Money Market Instruments of any single issuer. 
The limits laid down in the second, third and fourth indents may be disregarded at 
the time of acquisition if at that time the gross amount of the debt securities or of the 
Money Market Instruments, or the net amount of the instruments in issue, cannot be 
calculated. 
Exempted from the limits laid down above in 6.1 and 6.2 are 

 <Page36>  
 
36 
 
− 
transferable securities and Money Market Instruments which are issued or 
guaranteed by an EU Member State or its local authorities, by a non-EU 
Member State or which are issued by public international bodies of which 
one or more EU Member States are members; 
− 
shares held by the Company in the capital of a company incorporated in a 
non-EU Member State which invests its assets mainly in the securities of 
issuing bodies having their registered office in that State, where under the 
legislation of that State, such a holding represents the only way in which 
the UCITS can invest in the securities of issuing bodies of that State. This 
derogation, however, shall apply only if in its investment policy the 
company from the non-EU Member State complies with the limits laid 
down in articles 43 and 46 and article 48, paragraphs (1) and (2) of the 
Law. Where the limits set in articles 43 and 46 are exceeded, Article 49 of 
the Law shall apply mutatis mutandis; 
− 
shares held by one or more investment companies in the capital of 
subsidiary companies which carry on the business of management, advice 
or marketing in the country where the subsidiary is established, in regard 
to the repurchase of units at the request of unitholders exclusively on its 
 or their behalf; 
6.3. selling transferable securities, Money Market Instruments and other investment 
 instruments mentioned under sub-paragraphs e) g) and h) of paragraph 1.1 short; 
6.4. acquiring precious metals or related certificates; 
 
6.5. investing in real estate and purchasing or selling commodities or commodities contracts; 
 
6.6. borrowing on behalf of a particular Fund, unless: 
(ii) 
the borrowing is in the form of a back-to-back loan for the purchase 
of foreign currency; 
(iii) 
the loan is only temporary and does not exceed 10% of the net 
assets of the Fund in question; 
(iv) 
the borrowing enables the acquisition of immovable property 
essential for the direct pursuit of its business and represents no 
more than 10% of the net assets of the Fund. 
Where a Fund is authorised to borrow under points ii) and iii), that borrowing shall 
 not exceed 15% of its assets in total; 
6.7. granting loans to or acting as guarantor for third parties. This limitation does not refer to 
the purchase of transferable securities, Money Market Instruments and other investment 
instruments mentioned under sub-paragraphs e), g) and h) of paragraph 1.1 that are not 
fully paid up. 
    

 <Page37>  
 
37 
 
7. Risk management and limits with regard to derivative instruments and the use of 
techniques and instruments 
 
7.1. The Company must employ (i) a risk-management process which enables it to monitor 
and measure at any time the risk of the positions and their contribution to the overall risk 
profile of the portfolio and (ii) a process for accurate and independent assessment of the 
value of OTC Derivatives. In accordance with the Law and the applicable regulations, in 
particular Circular CSSF 11/512, the risk-management process enables it to assess the 
exposure of each Fund to market, liquidity and counterparty risks, and to all other risks, 
 including operational risks, which are material for the Fund. 
7.2. Each Fund shall ensure that its global risk exposure relating to derivative instruments does 
 not exceed its total Net Asset Value. 
The risk exposure is calculated taking into account the current value of the underlying 
assets, the risks of Approved Counterparties, future market movements and the time 
 available to liquidate the positions. This shall also apply to the following subparagraphs. 
A Fund may invest, as a part of its investment policy and within the limit laid down in 
paragraphs 2.8 and 2.9, in financial derivative instruments provided that the exposure to 
the underlying assets does not exceed in aggregate the investment limits laid down in 
section 2. If a Fund invests in index-based financial derivative instruments, these 
investments are not required to be combined for the purposes of the limits laid down in 
 section 2. 
When a transferable security or a Money Market Instrument embed a derivative, the latter 
 must be taken into account when complying with the requirements of this section. 
7.3. As part of the risk management process, each Fund uses either the commitment approach 
or the relative or absolute Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach to monitor and measure its global 
 exposure as disclosed in the relevant Supplement. 
The commitment approach measures the global exposure related to positions on 
derivative instruments under consideration of netting and hedging effects which may not 
exceed the total net value of the portfolio of the Fund. Under the standard commitment 
approach, each derivative instrument position is converted into the market value of an 
 equivalent position in the underlying asset of that derivative instrument. 
In financial mathematics and financial risk management, the VaR is a widely used risk 
measure of the risk of loss on a specific portfolio of financial assets. For a given investment 
portfolio, probability and time horizon, VaR is defined as a threshold value such that the 
probability that the mark-to-market loss on the investment portfolio over the given time 
horizon exceeds this value (assuming normal markets and no trading in the investment 
 portfolio) is the given probability level. 
The calculation of the VaR is conducted on the basis of a one-sided confidence interval of 
 99%, as well as a holding period of 20 days. 

 <Page38>  
 
38 
 
For a particular Fund using the relative VaR approach, its VaR is limited by twice the VaR 
 of a reference portfolio as stated in the relevant Supplement. 
For a particular Fund using the absolute VaR approach, its VaR is limited by an absolute 
VaR calculated on the basis of the net asset value of the Fund and not exceeding a 
maximum VaR limit determined by the Company taking into account the investment policy 
and the risk profile of the Fund. Such limit is described in the relevant Supplement and 
cannot exceed 20%. 
 
8. Techniques and Instruments for Hedging Currency Risks 
In order to protect its present and future assets and liabilities against the fluctuation of currencies, 
the Company may enter into foreign exchange transactions, call options or put options in respect 
of currencies, forward foreign exchange transactions, or transactions for the exchange of 
currencies, provided that these transactions be made either on a Regulated Market or over-the-
counter with First Class Institutions specialising in these types of transactions. 
The objective of the transactions referred to above presupposes the existence of a direct 
relationship between the contemplated transaction and the assets or liabilities to be hedged and 
implies that, in principle, transactions in a given currency including a currency bearing a substantial 
relation to the value of the reference currency of a Fund (usually referred to as “cross hedging”) 
may not exceed the total valuation of such assets and liabilities nor may they, as regards their 
duration, exceed the period where such assets are held or anticipated to be held or for which such 
 liabilities are incurred or anticipated to be incurred. 
9. Restrictions on Securities Lending and Repurchase Transactions 
The Company may employ techniques and instruments relating to transferable securities and 
Money Market Instruments provided that such techniques and instruments are used for the 
purposes of efficient portfolio management within the meaning of, and under the conditions set out 
in, applicable laws, regulations and circulars issued by the Authority from time to time. In particular, 
those techniques and instruments should not result in a change of the declared investment objective 
of the Fund or add substantial supplementary risks in comparison to the stated risk profile of the 
 Fund. 
The risk exposure to a counterparty generated through efficient portfolio management techniques 
and OTC financial derivatives must be combined when calculating counterparty risk limits referred 
 to under paragraphs 2.3. including rules applicable to collateral. 
All revenues arising from efficient portfolio management techniques, net of direct and indirect 
operational costs and fees, will be returned to the Company. In particular, fees and cost may be 
paid to agents of the Company and other intermediaries providing services in connection with 
efficient portfolio management techniques as normal compensation of their services. Such fees 
may be calculated as a percentage of gross revenues earned by the Company through the use of 
such techniques. Information on direct and indirect operational costs and fees that may be incurred 
in this respect as well as the identity of the entities to which such costs and fees are paid – as well 
as any relationship they may have with the Depositary, Investment Manager or the Management 
 Company– will be available in the annual report of the Company.  
 

 <Page39>  
 
39 
 
 
9.1. Securities lending transaction 
 
9.2. The Company may more specifically enter into securities lending transactions provided 
that the following rules are complied with in addition to the abovementioned conditions: 
 
(i) 
the borrower in a securities lending transaction must be subject to prudential 
supervision rules considered by the Authority as equivalent to those prescribed 
by EU law;  
 
(ii) 
the Company may only lend securities to a borrower either directly or through a 
standardised system organised by a recognised clearing institution or through 
a lending system organised by a financial institution with a minimum investment 
grade credit rating, and which have their headquarters in any of the OECD or 
G20 countries and which are subject to prudential supervision rules considered 
by the Authority as equivalent to those provided by EU law and are specialised 
in this type of transaction; 
 
(iii) 
the Company may only enter into securities lending transactions provided that 
it is entitled at any time under the terms of the agreement to request the return 
of the securities lent or to terminate the agreement. 
 
9.3. Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions 
The Company may enter into repurchase agreements that consist of forward transactions at the 
maturity of which the Company (seller) has the obligation to repurchase the assets sold and the 
counterparty (buyer) the obligation to return the assets purchased under the transactions. The 
Company may further enter into reverse repurchase agreements that consist of forward 
transactions at the maturity of which the counterparty (seller) has the obligation to repurchase the 
asset sold and the Company (buyer) the obligation to return the assets purchased under the 
transactions. The Company may also enter into transactions that consist of the purchase/sale of 
securities with a clause reserving for the counterparty/Company the right to repurchase the 
securities from the Company/counterparty at a price and term specified by the parties in their 
 contractual arrangements. 
The Company’s involvement in such transactions is, however, subject to the additional following 
 rules: 
(i) 
Authorised counterparties are either credit institutions which have their 
headquarters in any of the OECD or G20 countries or an investment firm, 
authorised under the MiFID directive, which are specialised in the relevant types 
of transactions, subject to equivalent prudential supervision, and with an 
investment credit rating  
 
(ii) 
the Company may only enter into reverse repurchase agreement and/or 
repurchase agreement transactions provided that it is able at any time (a) to 
recall the full amount of cash in a reverse repurchase agreement or any 
securities subject to a repurchase agreement or (b) to terminate the agreement 
in accordance with applicable regulations. However, fixed-term transactions 
that do not exceed seven days should be considered as arrangements on terms 
that allow the assets to be recalled at any time by the Company. 
 

 <Page40>  
 
40 
 
Subject to the acquisition of debt instruments, the making of bank deposits and the repurchase or 
buy and sell back transactions referred to above, the Company shall not make loans to third parties 
 or guarantee the obligations of third parties. 
 Master-feeder structures 
As disclosed in its Supplement, a particular Fund may act as a feeder fund (the “Feeder”) of a 
UCITS or of a compartment of such UCITS (the “Master”), which shall neither itself be a feeder 
fund nor hold units/shares of a feeder fund. In such a case and by way of derogation from the limits 
laid down in paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 6.2 third indent, the Feeder shall invest at least 85% of its net 
 assets in shares/units of the Master. 
 The Feeder may not invest more than 15% of its net assets in one or more of the following: 
(a) ancillary liquid assets in accordance with paragraph 1.2 above; 
(b) financial derivative instruments, which may be used only for hedging 
purposes, in accordance with paragraphs 1.1 (g), 7.1 and 7.2 above; 
(c) movable and immovable property which is essential for the direct pursuit of 
the Fund’s business. 
 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
The Company on behalf of a Fund may employ techniques and instruments relating to transferable 
securities and/or other financial instruments in which it invests for efficient portfolio management 
 purposes, details in respect of which (if any) shall be set out in the relevant Supplement. 
Techniques and instruments relating to transferable securities include securities lending and 
 borrowing as well as repurchase and buy-sell back transactions. 
Securities lending and borrowing transactions consist in transactions whereby a lender transfers 
securities or instruments to a borrower, subject to a commitment that the borrower will return 
equivalent securities or instruments on a future date or when requested to do so by the lender, 
such transaction being considered as securities lending for the party transferring the securities or 
instruments and being considered as securities borrowing for the counterparty to which they are 
 transferred. 
Repurchase agreements consist of transactions governed by an agreement whereby a party sells 
securities or instruments to a counterparty, subject to a commitment to repurchase them, or 
substituted securities or instruments of the same description, from the counterparty at a specified 
price on a future date specified, or to be specified, by the transferor. Such transactions are 
commonly referred to as repurchase agreements for the party selling the securities or instruments, 
and reverse repurchase agreements for the counterparty buying them. A reverse repurchase 
agreement transaction is a forward transaction at the maturity of which the seller (counterparty) has 
the obligation to repurchase the assets sold and the relevant Fund has the obligation to return the 
 assets received under the transaction.  
Buy-sell back transactions consist of transactions, not being governed by a repurchase agreement 
or a reverse repurchase agreement as described above, whereby a party buys or sells securities 
or instruments to a counterparty, agreeing, respectively, to sell to or buy back from that counterparty 
securities or instruments of the same description at a specified price on a future date. Such 
transactions are commonly referred to as buy-sell back transactions for the party buying the 
 securities or instruments, and sell-buy back transactions for the counterparty selling them.  
The annual report of the Company will contain, in respect of each Fund that has entered into 

 <Page41>  
 
41 
 
efficient portfolio management techniques information on: 
(i) 
the exposure obtained through efficient portfolio management techniques; 
(ii) 
the identity of the counterparty(ies) to these efficient portfolio management techniques; 
(iii) 
the type and amount of collateral received by the Company to reduce counterparty 
exposure; and 
(iv) 
the revenues arising from efficient portfolio management techniques for the entire reporting 
period together with the direct and indirect operational costs and fees incurred; 
(v)  
the direct and indirect operational costs and fees that may be incurred in this respect as 
well as the identity of the entities to which such costs and fees are paid – as well as any 
relationship they may have with the Depositary, the Investment Manager or the 
Management Company.  
 
 The use of such techniques is subject to the restriction and conditions referred to under section 9.  
For the time being, none of the Fund(s) has entered into any of these portfolio management 
 techniques. 
 Financial Derivatives  
The Company may use FDIs relating to transferable securities and money market instruments for 
efficient portfolio management, investment, hedging or other risk management purposes under the 
conditions set out in this Prospectus and the investment objective and policy of the Fund, as set 
 out in its Supplement. 
In particular, the Company can enter into one or several total return swap (“TRS”), whether funded 
or unfunded, to gain exposure to reference assets, which may be invested according to the 
investment policy of the relevant Fund. In particular, TRS may be used to gain exposures where a 
direct investible instrument is not available, or to implement the stated investment policy of the 
 relevant Fund in a more efficient manner. 
A TRS are contracts in which one party receives interest payments on a reference asset plus any 
capital gains and losses over the payment period, while the other receives a specified fixed or 
floating cash flow unrelated to the credit worthiness of the reference asset, especially where the 
payments are based on the same notional amount. The reference asset may be any asset, index, 
 or basket of assets. 
Where a Fund enters into a TRS or invests in other derivatives with similar characteristics: 
- 
the assets held by the Fund should comply with the investment limits set out in paragraphs 
2, 3, 4 and 6 above; and  
- 
the underlying exposures of such derivatives must be taken into account to calculate the 
investment limits laid down in paragraph 2.4 above.  
- 
none of the counterparties will have discretion over the composition or management of the 
portfolio of the Fund or the underlying assets of the financial derivative instruments. 
 
 Furthermore, the Company may only enter into such transactions through First Class Institutions. 
Each Fund may incur costs and fees in connection with TRS or other financial derivative 
instruments with similar characteristics, upon entering into TRS and/or any increase or decrease of 
their notional amount. The amount of these fees may be fixed or variable. Information on costs and 
fees incurred by each Fund in this respect, as well as the identity of the recipients and any affiliation 
they may have with the Depositary, the Investment Manager or the Management Company, if 
applicable, may be available in the annual report. All revenues arising from TRS, net of direct and 
indirect operational costs and fees, will be returned to the Fund. With regards to TRS, 100% of the 
revenues (or losses) generated by their execution are allocated to the Funds. The Investment 
Manager does not charge any additional costs or fees or receive any additional revenues in 
connection with TRS. Whilst additional costs may be inherent in certain products, these are 

 <Page42>  
 
42 
 
imposed by the counterparty based on market pricing, form part of the revenues or losses 
 generated by the relevant product, and are allocated 100% to the Funds. 
The annual report of the Company will contain, in respect of each Fund that has entered into TRS 
information on: 
- 
the underlying exposure obtained through these financial derivative instruments; 
- 
the identity of the counterparty(ies) to these financial derivative instruments; 
- 
the type and amount of collateral received to reduce counterparty risk exposure; 
- 
the costs and fees incurred by each Fund in this respect, as well as the identity of the 
recipients and any affiliation they may have with the Depositary, the Investment Manager 
 or the Management Company. 
 The use of such techniques is subject to the restriction and conditions referred to under section 9. 
The expected and maximum proportion of the total assets of the relevant Funds which may be 
 subject to those transactions is summarized in the relevant Supplement.  
 Uncovered Short Sales 
A Fund may not engage in uncovered short sales at any time. The Company will apply rules (as 
detailed below) with respect to transactions with both listed and ‘over-the-counter’ FDIs so as to 
ensure that each Fund retains appropriate cover for all transactions entered into on its behalf. 
 These rules will be applied to each Fund respectively. 
 Physically Settled Trades 
When the relevant FDI provides for, either automatically or at the choice of the Fund’s Approved 
Counterparty, physical delivery of the underlying financial instrument on maturity or exercise of the 
FDI, and provided that physical delivery of such underlying financial instrument is common practice, 
 the Fund will hold such underlying financial instrument as cover in its investment portfolio. 
In cases where the risks of the financial instrument underlying a FDI can be appropriately 
represented by another underlying financial instrument and such other underlying financial 
instrument is highly liquid (an “Alternative Financial Instrument”), the Fund may, in exceptional 
circumstances, hold such Alternative Financial Instruments as cover. In such circumstances, the 
Company shall ensure that such Alternative Financial Instruments can be used at any time to 
purchase the underlying financial instrument to be delivered and that the additional market risk 
 which is associated with that type of transaction is adequately measured. 
 Cash-Settled Trades 
Where the relevant FDI is cash-settled automatically or at the Company’s discretion, a Fund may 
elect not to hold the specific financial instrument underlying the FDI as cover. In such circumstances, 
such Fund will accept collateral in compliance with sub-section 2.4. “Management of collateral and 
 collateral policy”. 
The Company will require that the underlying financial instrument of FDIs, whether they provide for 
cash-settlement or physical delivery, as well as the financial instruments held as collateral have to 
be compliant with the Regulations, the section “Investment Restrictions” of the Prospectus and the 
 individual investment policy of the Fund. 
 Borrowing and Lending Powers 
The Company may borrow, for the account of a Fund, up to 10% of the Net Asset Value of a Fund 
provided that such borrowing is for a period of up to one Month to cover a cash shortfall caused by 

 <Page43>  
 
43 
 
mismatched settlement dates on purchase and sale transactions or on a temporary basis to finance 
repurchases. The assets of such Fund may be charged as security for any such borrowings. The 
Company may acquire foreign currency by means of a back to back loan agreement(s). Foreign 
currency obtained in this manner is not classified as borrowing for the above mentioned 10% limit 
provided that the offsetting deposit (a) is denominated in the Base Currency of the Fund and (b) 
 equals or exceeds the value of the foreign currency loan outstanding. 
 The Company may not borrow for investment purposes. 
Without prejudice to the powers of the Company to invest in transferable securities, the Company 
 may not lend cash, or act as guarantor on behalf of third parties. 
Any special borrowing restrictions relating to a Fund will be formulated by the Directors at the time 
 of the creation of a Fund. There are no special borrowing restrictions currently in operation. 
 Charges and Expenses 
When the Company on behalf of a Fund invests in the shares of other UCITS or collective 
investment undertakings or both and those other UCITS or collective investment undertakings are 
managed, directly or by delegation, by the Investment Manager or by any other company with which 
the Investment Manager is linked by common management or control, or by a substantial direct or 
indirect holding, the Investment Manager or other company shall not charge subscription or 
repurchase fees on account of the investment by the Company on behalf of the Fund in the shares 
 of such other UCITS or collective investment undertakings or both, as the case may be. 
If the Company on behalf of a Fund invests a substantial proportion of its net assets in other UCITS 
or non-UCITS collective investment undertakings or both, the maximum level of the management 
fees that may be charged to the Fund by such UCITS or non-UCITS collective investment 
undertakings or both, as the case may be, will be set out in the relevant Supplement. Details of 
 such fees will also be contained in the Company’s annual report. 
When a Fund qualifying as a Feeder Fund invests in the shares/units of a Master Fund, the Master 
Fund may not charge subscription or redemption fees on account of the Fund’s investment in the 
 shares/units of the Master Fund. 
Should a Fund qualify as Feeder Fund, a description of all remuneration and reimbursement of 
costs payable by the Feeder Fund by virtue of its investments in shares/units of the Master Fund, 
as well as the aggregate charges of both the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund, shall be disclosed 
in the Supplement of this particular Fund. In its annual report, the Company shall include a 
 statement on the aggregate charges of both the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund. 
Should a Fund qualify as a master fund of another UCITS, the latter will not be charged any 
subscription fees, redemption fees or contingent deferred sales charges, conversion fees, from the 
 Master Fund. 
 Dividend Policy 
The Directors decide the dividend policy and arrangements relating to each Fund and details are 
set out where applicable in the relevant Supplement. Under the Articles, the Directors are entitled 
to declare dividends out of the relevant Fund being: (i) the accumulated revenue (consisting of all 
revenue accrued including interest and dividends) less expenses and/or (ii) realised and unrealised 
capital gains on the disposal/valuation of investments and other funds less realised and unrealised 
accumulated capital losses of the relevant Fund and/or (iii) the capital of the relevant Fund. Where 
dividends will be paid out of the capital of the relevant Fund, this will be disclosed in the 
relevant Supplement. The Directors may satisfy any dividend due to Shareholders in whole or in 
part by distributing to them in specie any of the assets of the relevant Fund, and in particular any 

 <Page44>  
 
44 
 
investments to which the relevant Fund is entitled. A Shareholder may require the Company instead 
of transferring any assets in specie to him, to arrange for a sale of the assets and for payment to 
 the Shareholder of the net proceeds of same. 
Dividends not claimed within five years from their due date will lapse and revert to the relevant 
 Fund. 
Dividends payable to Shareholders will be paid by electronic transfer to the bank account 
designated by the Shareholder in which case the dividend will be paid at the expense of the payee 
 and will be paid within four Months of the date the Directors declared the dividend. 
 The dividend policy for each Fund is set out in the Supplement for the relevant Fund.

RISK FACTORS 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
The discussion below is of general nature and is intended to describe various risk factors which 
may be associated with an investment in the Shares of a Fund to which the attention of investors 
is drawn. See also the relevant Supplement for a discussion of any additional risks particular to 
Shares of that Fund. However, these are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other 
considerations that should be taken into account in relation to an investment. Investors should 
consult their own advisors before considering an investment in the Shares of a particular Fund. 
What factors will be of relevance to the Shares of a particular Fund will depend upon a number of 
interrelated matters including, but not limited to, the nature of the Shares, the Underlying (if 
applicable), the Fund Assets (if applicable) and the techniques used to link the Fund Assets to the 
 Underlying (if applicable). 
No investment should be made in the Shares of a particular Fund until careful consideration of all 
 those factors has been made. 
 Introduction 
The investments of the Company in securities are subject to normal market fluctuations and other 
risks inherent in investing in securities. The value of investments and the income from them, 
and therefore the value of and income from Shares relating to each Fund can go down as 
well as up and an investor may not get back the amount he invests. Changes in exchange 
rates between currencies or the conversion from one currency to another may also cause the value 
of the investments to diminish or increase. Due to the Preliminary Charge, Repurchase Charge 
and/or Contingent Deferred Sales which may be payable on the Shares, an investment in 
Shares should be viewed as medium to long term. An investment in a Fund should not 
constitute a substantial proportion of an investment portfolio and may not be appropriate 
 for all investors. 
An investment in the Shares involves risks. These risks may include or relate to, among others, 
equity market, bond market, foreign exchange, interest rate, credit, market volatility and political 
risks and any combination of these and other risks. Some of these risk factors are briefly discussed 
below. Prospective investors should be experienced with respect to transactions in instruments 
such as the Shares, the Fund Assets (if applicable), the Underlying (if applicable) and the 
techniques used to link the Fund Assets to the Underlying (if applicable). Investors should 
understand the risks associated with an investment in the Shares and should only reach an 
investment decision after careful consideration with their legal, tax, accounting, financial and other 
advisors of (i) the suitability of an investment in the Shares in the light of their own particular financial, 
fiscal and other circumstances, (ii) the information set out in this Prospectus and the relevant 
Supplement, (iii) the nature of the Underlying (if applicable), (iv) the risks associated with the use 
by the Fund of derivative techniques (if applicable), (v) the nature of the Fund Assets (if applicable), 
 and (vi) information set out in the relevant Supplement. 
Investors in the Shares should recognise that the Shares may decline in value and should be 
prepared to sustain a total loss of their investment in the Shares. Even where the Shares contain 
some form of capital protection feature via the investment in the Fund Assets (such form of capital 
protection feature - if any - being described in the relevant Supplement), the protection feature may 
not be fully applicable to the initial investment made by an investor in the Shares, especially (i) 
when the purchase, sale or subscription of the Shares does not take place during the Initial Offer 
Period, (ii) when Shares are repurchased or sold before their Scheduled Maturity Date (if any) or 
(iii) when the Fund Assets or the techniques used to link the Fund Assets to the Underlying fail to 
deliver the expected returns. An investment in the Shares should only be made after assessing the 
direction, timing and magnitude of potential future changes in the value of the Underlying and the 

 <Page46>  
 
46 
 
 Fund Assets, as the return of any such investment will be dependent, inter alia, upon such changes. 
Risk factors may occur simultaneously and/or may compound each other resulting in an 
unpredictable effect on the value of the Shares. No assurance can be given as to the effect that 
 any combination of risk factors may have on the value of the Shares. 
While the provisions of the Law provide for segregated liability between Funds, these provisions 
 have yet to be tested in foreign courts, in particular, in satisfying local creditors’ claims. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Valuation of the Underlying and the Fund Assets 
Investors in the Shares should be aware that such an investment involves assessing the risk of an 
investment linked to the Underlying and, where applicable, the Fund Assets and the techniques 
used to link the Fund Assets to the Underlying. Investors should be experienced with respect to 
transactions involving the purchase of Shares the value of which derives from an Underlying 
possibly in combination with a Fund Assets. The value of the Underlying and the Fund Assets and 
the value of the techniques used to link them may vary over time and may increase or decrease by 
reference to a variety of factors which may include, amongst others, corporate actions, macro 
economic factors and speculation. Where the Underlying is a basket of securities or one or more 
indices, the changes in the value of any one security or index may be offset or intensified by 
fluctuations in the value of other securities or indices which comprise such constituents of the 
 Underlying or by changes in the value of the Fund Assets itself. 
 Exchange Rates 
Investors in the Shares should be aware that an investment in the Shares may involve exchange 
rate risks. For example (i) the Underlying may directly or indirectly provide exposure to a number 
of different currencies of emerging market or developed countries; (ii) the Underlying and/or the 
Fund Assets may be denominated in a currency other than the Base Currency; (iii) the Shares may 
be denominated in a currency other than the currency of the investor's home jurisdiction; and/or (iv) 
the Shares may be denominated in a currency other than the currency in which an investor wishes 
to receive his monies. Exchange rates between currencies are determined by factors of supply and 
demand in the international currency markets, which are influenced by macro economic factors 
(such as the economic development in the different currency areas, interest rates and international 
capital movements), speculation and central bank and government intervention (including the 
imposition of currency controls and restrictions). Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the 
 value of the Shares. 
 Interest Rate 
Investors in the Shares should be aware that an investment in the Shares may involve interest rate 
risk in that there may be fluctuations in the currency of denomination of the Underlying and/or the 
 Fund Assets (if applicable) and/or the Shares. 
Interest rates are determined by factors of supply and demand in the international money markets 
which are influenced by macro economic factors, speculation and central bank and government 
intervention. Fluctuations in short term and/or long term interest rates may affect the value of the 
Shares. Fluctuations in interest rates of the currency in which the Shares are denominated and/or 
fluctuations in interest rates of the currency or currencies in which the Underlying and/or the Fund 
 Assets are denominated may affect the value of the Shares. 
 Market Volatility 
Market volatility reflects the degree of instability and expected instability of the performance of the 

 <Page47>  
 
47 
 
Shares, the Underlying and/or the Fund Assets, and/or the techniques to link the Fund Assets to 
the Underlying, where applicable. The level of market volatility is not purely a measurement of the 
actual volatility, but is largely determined by the prices for instruments which offer investors 
protection against such market volatility. The prices of these instruments are determined by forces 
of supply and demand in the options and derivatives markets generally. These forces are, 
themselves, affected by factors such as actual market volatility, expected volatility, macro economic 
 factors and speculation. 
 Credit Risk 
Investors in the Shares should be aware that such an investment may involve credit risk. Bonds or 
other debt securities involve credit risk to the issuer which may be evidenced by the issuer's credit 
rating. Securities which are subordinated and/or have a lower credit rating are generally considered 
to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities. In 
the event that any issuer of bonds or other debt securities experiences financial or economic 
difficulties, this may affect the value of the relevant securities (which may be zero) and any amounts 
paid on such securities (which may be zero). This may in turn affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
Investors in any Fund whose performance is linked to an Underlying should be aware that the Fund 
Assets for any such Fund will generally include bonds or other debt instruments that involve credit 
risk. Moreover, where such Fund provides for a capital protection feature, the functioning of such 
feature will often be dependent on the due payment of the interest and principal amounts on the 
 bonds or other debt instruments in which the Fund is invested as the Fund Assets. 
 Credit Derivatives 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a company (referred to as the “reference entity”) may fail to perform 
its payment obligations under a transaction when they are due to be performed as a result of 
deterioration in its financial condition. This is a risk for the other companies or parties who enter 
into transactions with the reference entity or in some other way have exposure to the credit of the 
reference entity. The term “transactions” is used widely. It can include loan agreements entered 
 into by the reference entity and also securities issued by the reference entity. 
The parties which bear credit risk of a reference entity may seek to pass on this risk through a 
“credit derivative transaction” with other companies. A derivative is a financial instrument which 
derives its value from an Underlying or variable. In the case of a credit derivative transaction the 
credit risk of the reference entity defaulting is the relevant variable. Many financial institutions or 
banks will regularly quote prices for entering into or selling a credit derivative transaction. For a 
financial institution or bank credit derivatives transactions may be a large part of its business. Prices 
are quoted on the basis of an analysis of the credit risk of the relevant reference entity. If 
participants in the credit derivatives market think that a credit event (as described in the following 
paragraph) is likely to occur in relation to a particular reference entity, then the cost of buying credit 
protection through a credit derivative transaction will increase. This is regardless of whether or not 
there has been an actual default by the reference entity. The party to the credit derivative 
transaction which purchases credit protection is referred to as the “credit protection buyer” and the 
 party which sells the credit protection is referred to as the “credit protection seller”. 
The credit protection buyer and credit protection seller will agree between them the types of event 
which may constitute a “credit event” in relation to the relevant reference entity. Typical credit 
events include (i) the insolvency of the reference entity (ii) its failure to pay a specified amount (iii) 
a restructuring of the debt owed or guaranteed by the reference entity due to a deterioration in its 
financial condition (iv) a repudiation or moratorium where the reference entity announces that it will 
no longer make certain payments or agrees with its lenders a delay or deferral in making payments 
or (v) a requirement that the reference entity accelerate payment of its obligation. To a large extent 
the credit events are determined by reference to specified obligations of the reference entity or 
obligations guaranteed by the reference entity, as selected by the credit protection buyer. These 
are referred to as “reference obligations”. 

 <Page48>  
 
48 
 
 
If a specified credit event occurs in respect of the relevant reference entity, or in respect of a 
reference obligation, the credit protection seller may be obliged to purchase the reference 
obligation at par (typically 100 per cent. of its face amount) from the credit protection buyer. The 
credit protection seller can then sell the obligation in the market at the market price which is 
expected to be lower than par (because the reference entity has suffered a credit event, its 
obligations are less likely to be met and therefore are worth less in the market). The proceeds of 
sale are called “recoveries”. The loss that the credit protection seller incurs (par value minus 
recoveries) is assumed to be the same as the loss that a holder of such obligation would incur 
following the occurrence of a credit event. This type of credit derivative transaction is referred to as 
 a “physically settled credit derivative transaction”. 
Often credit derivative transactions are drafted such that there is no physical delivery of the relevant 
obligation against the payment of the par value. Instead, the recovery value is determined by 
obtaining quotations for the reference obligation from other credit derivatives market participants. 
Following market practice, a credit protection buyer is likely to select a reference obligation with 
the lowest market value. Consequently the recovery value will be less than would otherwise be the 
case. The credit protection seller must then make a payment (sometimes referred to as a loss 
amount) to the credit protection buyer equal to the difference between par value and recovery value. 
This is referred to as a “cash settled credit derivative transaction”. If no specified credit event occurs, 
the credit protection seller receives periodic payments from the credit protection buyer for the credit 
protection it provides but does not have to make any payments to the credit protection buyer. These 
are referred to as credit premiums. Typically the credit protection buyer acts as calculation agent 
 and makes all determinations in relation to the credit derivative transaction. 
 Credit portfolio transactions 
A number of banks and financial institutions structure credit derivative transactions known as “credit 
portfolio transactions”. This refers to there being a portfolio of reference entities rather than a single 
reference entity. Each reference entity represents a certain proportion of the portfolio. Where a 
credit event occurs in relation to a reference entity, that reference entity will be removed from the 
portfolio and, in the case of a cash settled credit derivative transaction, the credit protection seller 
 will pay the relevant cash amount to the credit protection buyer. 
In relation to credit portfolio transactions, there are often a number of different credit protection 
sellers arranged in an order of priority. The part of the credit portfolio for which a credit protection 
seller is responsible is referred to as a tranche. Each credit protection seller will be responsible for 
paying the relevant amounts following a credit event, depending on the position of their particular 
tranche in the credit portfolio. For example, the credit protection seller in relation to the lowest 
tranche often referred to as the “equity tranche”, will pay loss amounts to the credit protection buyer 
up to a certain limit. These loss amounts will become payable in relation to the first credit event to 
occur in the credit portfolio and also subsequent credit events. However when the credit protection 
seller in relation to the lowest tranche has paid loss amounts up to the relevant limit it has no further 
obligations. This limit is referred to as the threshold amount in relation to the next tranche. Where 
subsequent credit events occur the credit protection seller in relation to the next tranche will then 
be required to pay amounts up to its agreed limit and so on. It is more likely that the credit protection 
seller in relation to the lowest tranche of the credit portfolio will be required to pay amounts to the 
credit protection buyer. On the other hand it is less likely that the credit protection seller in relation 
to the highest tranche of the credit portfolio will be required to pay amounts to the credit protection 
 buyer. 
The credit premiums payable by the credit protection buyer reflect the different levels of risk 
assumed by a credit protection seller. A high credit premium will be payable to the credit protection 
seller in relation to the lowest tranche and a lower credit premium will be payable to the credit 
 protection seller in relation to the highest tranche. 

 <Page49>

 Credit linked securities 
Credit linked securities are structured so that amounts payable under the securities are determined 
in whole or in part by reference to a credit derivative transaction. Credit linked securities may relate 
to a credit derivative transaction on a single reference entity or on a portfolio of reference entities. 
Many credit linked securities are issued by companies resident in an offshore jurisdiction (also 
known as special purpose vehicles). These issuers typically use the issue proceeds of the 
securities to purchase other securities issued by a third party issuer (referred to as “collateral”). At 
the same time the issuer enters into a credit derivative transaction with swap counterparty, also 
sometimes known as a “hedging counterparty”. The issuer acts as the credit protection seller and 
the hedging counterparty is the credit protection buyer. In economic terms it might also be said the 
security-holders act as credit protection sellers. In exchange for the credit protection, the hedging 
counterparty will pay certain credit premiums to the issuer which it may pass on to security-holders 
in the form of interest payments. The issuer may also enter into other hedging arrangements such 
as an asset hedging agreement under which the issuer may swap all payment flows of the collateral 
for all amounts owing to the security-holders. Where a credit event occurs under the credit 
derivative transaction requiring the issuer to make a payment under the credit derivative transaction, 
the issuer will realise an amount of the collateral to satisfy that obligation. In relation to a credit 
portfolio transaction this obligation will only arise where the credit protection provided by lower 
tranche(s) of the credit portfolio has already been used up. Where collateral is realised, the 
outstanding nominal amount or other relevant value of the securities will be reduced. To the extent 
that all the collateral is fully applied in this way, then the securities will be worthless and will be 
terminated early at zero. If the securities remain outstanding at maturity, then the amount of 
 collateral remaining, if any, will be applied to paying redemption amounts to security-holders. 
Reinvestment of collateral received in connection with securities lending and repurchase 
 transactions 
The Funds may reinvest the collateral received in connection with securities lending and 
repurchase transactions. Reinvestment of the collateral involves risks associated with the type of 
 investments made. 
 Credit Ratings 
Credit ratings are assigned by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's (S&P). It is important to 
understand the nature of credit ratings in order to understand the nature of the securities. The level 
of a credit rating is an indication of the probability that (in the opinion of the rating agency) payments 
will be made on the relevant bond(s) or other obligation(s) to which the credit rating relates. Bonds 
with a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB by S&P are called “investment grade” bonds and this indicates 
that the risk of a failure to repay amounts is limited. While credit ratings can be a useful tool for 
financial analysis, they are not a guarantee of quality or a guarantee of future performance in 
relation to the relevant obligations. Ratings assigned to securities by rating agencies may not fully 
 reflect the true risks of an investment. Ratings may also be withdrawn at any time. 
 Liquidity Risk 
Certain types of assets or securities may be difficult to buy or sell, particularly during adverse 
market conditions. This may affect the ability to obtain prices for the components of the Underlying 
and may therefore affect the value of the Underlying. This may in turn affect the Net Asset Value 
 per Share. 
 Additional risks associated with an Underlying linked to specific types of securities or assets 
There are special risk considerations associated with an Underlying of which the performance is 
linked directly or indirectly to the following types of securities or assets. The degree of exposure to 
such factors will depend on the precise way in which the Underlying is linked to such assets. 

 <Page50>  
 
50 
 
 
1 
Futures and Options 
 
There are special risk considerations associated with an Underlying of which the performance is 
linked to futures, options or other derivative contracts. Depending on the nature of the Underlyings, 
reference rates or other derivatives to which they relate and on the liquidity in the relevant contract, 
 the prices of such instruments may be highly volatile and hence risky in nature. 
2 
CTA Deposits 
 
A CTA Deposit is a margin investment account held with a bank and managed by a Commodity 
Trading Advisor registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission or any other 
relevant regulatory authority, under terms that the Commodity Trading Advisor may engage in 
trading on a margin (leveraged or geared) basis in a variety of liquid financial instruments including 
listed and unlisted futures, forwards and options relating to a variety of asset classes including but 
not limited to interest rates, fixed income securities, commodities, currencies and equities (and may 
also engage in trading directly in a number of such asset classes). Accordingly the risks relating to 
an exposure directly or indirectly to CTA Deposits will be a complicated function of the risks 
associated with the Underlying class, the risks associated with the derivative or other instrument 
 by which such exposure is assumed and the level of gearing. 
3 
Structured Finance Securities 
 
Structured finance securities include, without limitation, asset-backed securities and portfolio credit-
 linked notes. 
Asset-backed securities are securities primarily serviced, or secured, by the cash flows of a pool of 
receivables (whether present or future) or other Underlyings, either fixed or revolving. Such 
Underlyings may include, without limitation, residential and commercial mortgages, leases, credit 
card receivables as well as consumer and corporate debt. Asset-backed securities can be 
structured in different ways, including “true sale” structures, where the Underlyings are transferred 
to a special purpose entity, which in turn issues the asset-backed securities, and “synthetic” 
structures, in which not the assets, but only the credit risks associated with them are transferred 
 through the use of derivatives, to a special purpose entity, which issues the asset backed securities. 
Portfolio credit-linked notes are securities in respect of which the payment of principal and interest 
is linked directly or indirectly to one or more managed or unmanaged portfolios of reference entities 
and/or assets (reference credits). Upon the occurrence of a credit-related trigger event (credit 
event) with respect to a reference credit (such as a bankruptcy or a payment default), a loss amount 
will be calculated (equal to, for example, the difference between the par value of an asset and its 
 recovery value). 
Asset-backed securities and portfolio credit-linked notes are usually issued in different tranches. 
Any losses realised in relation to the Underlyings or, as the case may be, calculated in relation to 
the reference credits are allocated first to the securities of the most junior tranche, until the principal 
 of such securities is reduced to zero, then to the principal of the next lowest tranche, and so forth. 
Accordingly, in the event that (a) in relation to asset-backed securities, the Underlyings do not 
perform and/or (b) in relation to portfolio credit-linked notes, any one of the specified credit events 
occurs with respect to one or more of the Underlyings or reference credits, this may affect the value 
of the relevant securities (which may be zero) and any amounts paid on such securities (which may 
be zero). This may in turn affect the Net Asset Value per Share. In addition the value of structured 
finance securities from time to time, and consequently the Net Asset Value per Share, may be 
adversely affected by macro economic factors such as adverse changes affecting the sector to 
which the Underlyings or reference credits belong (including industry sectors, services and real 
estate), economic downturns in the respective countries or globally, as well as circumstances 

 <Page51>  
 
51 
 
related to the nature of the individual assets (for example, project finance loans are subject to risks 
connected to the respective project). The implications of such negative effects thus depend heavily 
on the geographic, sector-specific and type-related concentration of the Underlyings or reference 
credits. The degree to which any particular asset-backed security or portfolio credit linked note is 
affected by such events will depend on the tranche to which such security relates; junior tranches, 
 even having received investment grade rating, can therefore be subject to substantial risks. 
Exposure to structured finance securities may entail a higher liquidity risk than exposure to 
sovereign or corporate bonds. In the absence of a liquid market for the respective structured finance 
securities, they may only be traded at a discount from face value and not at the fair value, which 
 may in turn affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
4 
Real Estate 
 
There are special risk considerations associated with an Underlying of which the performance is 
linked to securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate industry. These include: the 
cyclical nature of real estate values, risks related to general and local economic conditions, 
overbuilding and increased competition, increases in property taxes and operating expenses, 
demographic trends and variations in rental income, changes in zoning laws, casualty or 
condemnation losses, environmental risks, regulatory limitations on rents, changes in 
neighbourhood values, related party risks, changes in the appeal of properties to tenants, increases 
in interest rates and other real estate capital market influences. Generally, increases in interest 
rates will increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could directly and indirectly decrease the 
 value of the Underlying and thus the Fund's investments. 
5 
Commodities 
 
Prices of commodities are influenced by, among other things, various macro economic factors such 
as changing supply and demand relationships, weather conditions and other natural phenomena, 
agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary, and exchange control programmes and policies of 
governments (including government intervention in certain markets) and other unforeseeable 
 events. 
6 
Emerging Market Assets 
 
Exposure to emerging markets assets generally entails greater risks than exposure to well-
 developed markets, including potentially significant legal economic and political risks. 
Emerging markets are by definition “in transformation” and are therefore exposed to the risk of swift 
political change and economic downturn. In recent years, many emerging market countries have 
undergone significant political, economic and social change. In many cases, political concerns have 
resulted in significant economic and social tensions and in some cases both political and economic 
instability has occurred. Political or economic instability may have a negative impact on the prices 
 of emerging market exchange rates, securities or other assets. 
The prices of emerging market exchange rates, securities or other assets are often highly volatile. 
Movements in such prices are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing market 
supply and demand, external market forces (particularly in relation to major trading partners), trade, 
fiscal, monetary programmes, policies of governments, and international political and economic 
 events and policies. 
In emerging markets, the development of securities markets usually is at an early stage. This could 
lead to risks and practises (such as increased volatility) that are not common in more developed 
securities markets, which may negatively affect the value of securities listed on the exchanges of 
such countries. In addition, markets of emerging market countries are often characterised by 
illiquidity in the form of a low turnover of some or all of the listed securities. 

 <Page52>  
 
52 
 
 
It is important to note that, during times of global economic slowdown, emerging market exchange 
rates, securities and other assets are more likely than other forms of investment with lower risks to 
 be sold during any “flight to quality”, and their value may decrease accordingly. 
 Risks associated with the Underlying 
There is no assurance that the Underlying will continue to be calculated and published on the basis 
described in the relevant Supplement or that it will not be amended significantly. Any change to the 
Underlying may adversely affect the value of the Shares. The past performance of an Underlying 
 is not necessarily a guide to its future performance. 
Where the Underlying consists of an Index it will not be actively managed and the selection of the 
component indices, assets or securities will be made in accordance with the relevant Index 
composition rules and eligibility criteria and not by reference to any performance criteria or 
performance outlook. Accordingly, the composition of the Index is not designed to follow 
recommendations or research reports issued by the Index Sponsor, its affiliates or any other person. 
No Index Sponsor has any obligation to take the needs of the Company or the investors into 
 consideration in determining, composing or calculating any Underlying. 
 Specific risks relating to Funds whose performance is linked to an Underlying 
 The following factors may adversely affect the value of the Shares of such Funds: 
1 
the Fund must pay various expenses, such as fees, costs, taxes, commissions, charges 
and dividends (if applicable); 
 
2 
the Company must comply with regulatory constraints, such as the Investment Restrictions, 
that may lead to a restructuring of a Fund's investments; 
 
3 
the Fund may not always continuously be exposed to the Underlying; 
 
4 
the Company may purchase Debt Securities the value of which will increase or decrease 
over time by reference to a variety of factors including, amongst others, corporate actions, 
macro economic factors and speculation; 
 
5 
the Company will enter into Derivative Contracts with a maturity date which may be different 
from the Scheduled Maturity Date of the relevant Shares. There can be no assurance that 
any new Derivative Contracts entered into will have terms similar to those previously 
entered into; and 
 
6 
the existence of a cash position held by the Fund. 
 
 Use of Derivatives 
As a Fund whose performance is linked to an Underlying will often be invested in Funded Swaps, 
Unfunded Swaps or securities which will differ from the Underlying, derivative techniques will be 
used to link the value of the Shares to the performance of the Underlying. While the prudent use 
of such derivatives can be beneficial, derivatives also involve risks different from, and, in certain 
cases, greater than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. The following is a general 
discussion of important risk factors and issues concerning the use of derivatives that investors 
 should understand before investing in Shares of a Fund. 
 Market Risk 
This is a general risk that applies to all investments meaning that the value of a particular derivative 

 <Page53>  
 
53 
 
 may change in a way which may be detrimental to a Fund's interests. 
 Legal Risk 
The Company must comply with regulatory constraints or changes in the laws affecting it, the 
Shares or the Investment Restrictions, which might require a change in the investment policy and 
objectives followed by a Fund. The Fund Assets, the Underlying and the derivative techniques used 
to link the two may also be subject to changes in law or regulations and/or regulatory actions which 
 may affect their value. 
 Control and Monitoring 
Derivative products are highly specialised instruments that require investment techniques and risk 
analysis different from those associated with equity and fixed income securities. The use of 
derivative techniques requires an understanding not only of the Underlying but also of the derivative 
itself, without the benefit of observing the performance of the derivative under all possible market 
conditions. In particular, the use and complexity of derivatives require the maintenance of adequate 
controls to monitor the transactions entered into, the ability to assess the risk that a derivative adds 
to a Fund and the ability to forecast the relative price, interest rate or currency rate movements 
 correctly. 
 Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk exists when a particular instrument is difficult to purchase or sell. If a derivative 
transaction is particularly large or if the relevant market is illiquid (as is the case with many privately 
negotiated derivatives), it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an 
 advantageous price, or at all. 
 Counterparty Risk 
The Company on behalf of a Fund may enter into transactions in over-the-counter markets, which 
will expose the Fund to the credit of its Approved Counterparties and their ability to satisfy the terms 
of such contracts. For example, the Company on behalf of the Fund may enter into repurchase 
agreements, forward contracts, options and swap arrangements or other derivative techniques, 
each of which expose the Fund to the risk that such Approved Counterparty may default on its 
obligations to perform under the relevant contract. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of an 
Approved Counterparty, the Fund could experience delays in liquidating the position and significant 
losses, including declines in the value of its investment during the period in which the Company 
seeks to enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment during such period and 
fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. There is also a possibility that the above 
agreements and derivative techniques are terminated due, for instance, to bankruptcy, supervening 
illegality or change in the tax or accounting laws relative to those at the time the agreement was 
originated. In such circumstances, investors may be unable to cover any losses incurred. Derivative 
Contracts such as swap contracts entered into by the Company on behalf of a Fund on the advice 
of the Investment Manager involve credit risk that could result in a loss of the Fund’s entire 
investment as the Fund may be fully exposed to the credit worthiness of a single Approved 
 Counterparty, where such an exposure will not be collateralised. 
 Collateral Management Risk 
Counterparty risk arising from investments in OTC financial derivative instruments is generally 
mitigated by the transfer or pledge of collateral in favour of the Company. However, transactions 
may not be fully collateralised. Fees and returns due to the Company may not be collateralised. If 
a counterparty defaults, the Company may need to sell non-cash collateral received at prevailing 
market prices. In such a case the Company could realise a loss due, inter alia, to inaccurate pricing 
or monitoring of the collateral, adverse market movements, deterioration in the credit rating of 

 <Page54>  
 
54 
 
issuers of the collateral or illiquidity of the market on which the collateral is traded. Difficulties in 
 selling collateral may delay or restrict the ability of the Company to meet redemption requests. 
The Company may also incur a loss in reinvesting cash collateral received, where permitted. Such 
a loss may arise due to a decline in the value of the investments made. A decline in the value of 
such investments would reduce the amount of collateral available to be returned by the Company 
to the counterparty as required by the terms of the transaction. The Company would be required to 
cover the difference in value between the collateral originally received and the amount available to 
 be returned to the counterparty, thereby resulting in a loss to the Company. 
 Other Risks 
Investors should note that derivatives may be terminated early, in accordance with their specific 
terms upon the occurrence of certain events, including but not limited to disruption in any hedging 
(which, for example, may occur where an Approved Counterparty or any other counterparty is 
unable, after using commercially reasonable efforts to acquire, establish, re-establish, substitute, 
maintain, unwind or dispose of any transactions or assets it deems necessary to hedge the price 
risk of entering into and performing its obligations with respect to the relevant transaction, or to 
realize, recover or remit the proceeds of any such transactions or assets) in relation to an Approved 
Counterparty, any other counterparty or the relevant Fund, or failure to pay, insolvency or the 
imposition of withholding tax on the payments due by either party. Upon such early termination, the 
relevant Fund, an Approved Counterparty or other counterparty (as the case may be) may be liable 
to make a termination payment (regardless of which party may have caused such termination) 
 based on the mark to market value of the derivative at the relevant time. 
Other risks in using derivatives include the risk of differing valuations of derivatives arising out of 
different permitted valuation methods and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with 
underlying securities, rates and indices. Many derivatives, in particular over-the-counter derivatives, 
are complex and often valued subjectively and the valuation can only be provided by a limited 
number of market professionals which often are acting as counterparties to the transaction to be 
valued. Inaccurate valuations can result in increased cash payment requirements to counterparties 
or a loss of value to a Fund. Derivatives do not always perfectly or even highly correlate or replicate 
the value of the securities, rates or indices they are designed to replicate. Consequently, a Fund's 
use of derivative techniques may not always be an effective means of, and sometimes could be 
 counterproductive to, following such Fund's investment objective. 
 Use of Securities Lending, Repurchase or Reverse Repurchase Transactions 
The principal risk when engaging in securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase 
transactions is the risk of default by a counterparty who has become insolvent or is otherwise 
unable or refuses to honour its obligations to return securities or cash to the Company as required 
by the terms of the transaction. Counterparty risk is mitigated by the transfer or pledge of collateral 
in favor of the Company. However, securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase 
transactions may not be fully collateralised. Fees and returns due to the Company under securities 
lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions may not be collateralised. In addition, the 
value of collateral may decline in between collateral rebalancing dates or may be incorrectly 
determined or monitored. In such a case, if a counterparty defaults, the Company may need to sell 
 non-cash collateral received at prevailing market prices, thereby resulting in a loss to the Fund. 
The Company may also incur a loss in reinvesting cash collateral received. Such a loss may arise 
due to a decline in the value of the investments made. A decline in the value of such investments 
would reduce the amount of collateral available to be returned by the Company to the counterparty 
as required by the terms of the transaction. The Company would be required to cover the difference 
in value between the collateral originally received and the amount available to be returned to the 
 counterparty, thereby resulting in a loss to the Company. 

 <Page55>  
 
55 
 
Securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions also entail operational risks such 
as the non-settlement or delay in settlement of instructions and legal risks related to the 
 documentation used in respect of such transactions. 
A Fund may enter into securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase transactions with other 
companies in the same group of companies as the Investment Manager. Affiliated counterparties, 
if any, will perform their obligations under any securities lending, repurchase or reverse repurchase 
transactions concluded with the Fund in a commercially reasonable manner. In addition, the 
Investment Manager will select counterparties and enter into transactions in accordance with best 
execution and at all times in the best interests of the Fund and its investors. However, investors 
should be aware that the Investment Manager may face conflicts between its role and its own 
 interests or that of affiliated counterparties. 
 Additional Risk Factors when investing in Shares listed on a Stock Exchange 
 Listing Procedure 
The Company may apply for the listing of certain Classes of the Shares on stock exchanges as 
determined by the Directors. There can be no certainty, however, that a listing on such stock 
 exchanges will be achieved. 
 Liquidity and Secondary Trading 
Even though the Shares may be listed on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no certainty 
that there will be liquidity in the Shares on one or more of the stock exchanges or that the market 
price at which the Shares may be traded on a stock exchange will be the same as the Net Asset 
Value per Share. There can be no guarantee that once the Shares are listed on a stock exchange 
 they will remain listed or that the conditions of listing will not change. 
Trading in Shares on a stock exchange may be halted due to market conditions or, because in the 
stock exchange’s view, trading the Shares is inadvisable. In addition, trading in the Shares may be 
subject to a halt in trading caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to the stock 
exchange's rules. If trading on a stock exchange is halted, investors in Shares may not be able to 
sell their Shares until trading resumes. Although, where applicable, the Shares are listed on a stock 
exchange, it may be that the principal market for some Shares may be in the over-the-counter 
market. The existence of a liquid trading market for the Shares may in such case depend on 
 whether broker-dealers will make a market in such Shares. 
Although as a condition precedent to listing on certain stock exchanges one or more market makers, 
being financial institutions, might be appointed to offer prices for the Shares, there can be no 
assurance that a market will continually be made for any of the Shares or that such market will be 
or remain liquid. The price at which Shares may be sold will be adversely affected if trading markets 
 for the Shares are limited or absent. 
 Variation of Net Asset Value per Share and Trading Prices on the Secondary Market 
The Net Asset Value per Share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Underlying, 
the derivative techniques used and where applicable the Fund Assets and changes in the exchange 
rate between the Base Currency or, if different, the listing currency of a Share and any relevant 
foreign currency of such Underlying and/or Fund Assets. The market price of the Shares will 
fluctuate in accordance with the changes in the Net Asset Value per Share and the supply and 
demand on the stock exchange on which the Shares are listed. The Company cannot predict 
whether the Shares will trade below, at or above their Net Asset Value per Share. Price differences 
may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces in the secondary market for 
the Shares will be closely related, but not identical to the same forces influencing the trading prices 
of the Underlying and where applicable the Fund Assets, individually or in the aggregate, at any 

 <Page56>  
 
56 
 
point in time. Furthermore, the listing on multiple exchanges of the Shares may result in price 
 differences between such exchanges because of fiscal, regulatory or other market factors. 
A broker-dealer, in considering the price at which it would be able to sell the Shares (known as the 
offer price) on the secondary market, or to buy Shares (known as the bid price) may seek arbitrage 
opportunities through anomalies or variations in the pricing of the Shares on the secondary market 
compared to the relative Net Asset Value per Share. The broker-dealer seeking to arbitrage such 
anomalies or variations, will take account of the notional price at which it could (i) purchase (when 
Shares in the secondary market are being priced above the Net Asset Value per Share) the building 
blocks providing the (combined) return of the Underlying (and as the case may be the Fund Assets); 
or (ii) sell (when Shares in the secondary market are being priced below the Net Asset Value per 
Share) such building blocks generating the (combined) return of the Underlying (and as the case 
 may be the Fund Assets) including in each case the associated transaction costs and any taxation. 
 Specific Risks Relating to Funds Replicating the Performance of an Underlying 
A Fund replicating the performance of the Underlying is not expected to replicate its relevant 
Underlying with the same degree of accuracy as would an investment vehicle that is entirely 
invested in every Underlying Security. However, it is intended that the difference between the 
performance of the Shares of the Fund (before the Fund's fees, administration, trading, dealing 
and bid/offer expenses) and the performance of the Underlying will not be substantial. Investors 
should note that exceptional circumstances, such as, but not limited to, disruptive market conditions 
or extremely volatile markets, may arise which cause a Fund's replicating accuracy to be 
substantially different from the performance of the Underlying. Also, there can be a delay between 
the recomposition occurring within the Underlying and the investments made by the Fund. Due to 
various constraints, the Fund may require more time to recompose its portfolio which can 
substantially affect the Fund's degree of replicating accuracy which can be different from the 
Underlying. Additionally, for certain Funds, due to the composition of each of their Underlyings, it 
may not be practicably possible, for example because of the Investment Restrictions, to achieve 
 such a level of replicating accuracy. 
 The following factors may adversely affect the replicating by a Fund of its Underlying: 
1 
the Fund must pay various fees and expenses, while the Underlying does not reflect any 
expenses; 
 
2 
in certain of the Funds the securities held by those Funds may not be identical to the 
Underlying Constituents but will be chosen to give similar performance; their investment 
performance is likely to differ from that of the Underlying Constituents; 
 
3 
a Fund must comply with regulatory constraints, such as the Investment Restrictions, that 
do not affect the calculation of a Fund's corresponding Underlying; 
 
4 
the existence of un-invested assets in the Funds (including cash and deferred fees and 
expenses); and 
 
5 
a Fund may be subject to a different foreign withholding tax rate than that assumed by its 
Index. 
 
Although the Investment Manager will regularly monitor the replicating accuracy of the relevant 
Fund, there can be no assurance as to the accuracy with which any Fund will replicate the 
 performance of its Underlying. 
 Certain Hedging Considerations 
Investors intending to purchase the Shares for the purpose of hedging their exposure to the 

 <Page57>  
 
57 
 
Underlying should be aware of the risks of utilising the Shares in such manner. No assurance is or 
can be given that the value of the Shares will correlate with movements in the value of the 
Underlying. This risk is especially prevalent if the Fund’s performance is linked to an Underlying, 
as the Fund will generally be investing in the Fund Assets and not in the Underlying. Furthermore, 
it may not be possible to liquidate the Shares at a price which directly reflects the value of the 
Underlying. Therefore, it is possible that investors could suffer substantial losses in the Shares 
notwithstanding losses suffered with respect to direct investments in or direct exposure to the 
Underlying. Investors in the Shares should be aware that hedging transactions, in order to limit the 
 risks associated with the Shares, might not be successful. 
 Specific Restrictions in Connection with the Shares 
Investors should note that there may be restrictions in connection with the subscription, holding and 
repurchase of and trading in the Shares. Such restrictions may have the effect of preventing the 
investor from freely subscribing, holding, trading and/or repurchasing the Shares. In addition to the 
features described below, such restrictions may also be caused by specific requirements such as 
the Minimum Initial Investment Amount, the Minimum Additional Investment Amount and the 
 Minimum Shareholding. 
 Maximum Repurchase Amount 
The Company will have the option to limit the number of Shares of any Fund repurchased on any 
Dealing Day (other than at the Scheduled Maturity Date, where applicable) to 10% of the total Net 
Asset Value of that Fund on that Dealing Day and, in conjunction with such limitation, to pro rata 
limit the number of Shares repurchased by any Shareholder on such Dealing Day so that all 
Shareholders wishing to have Shares of that Fund repurchased on that Dealing Day realise the 
same proportion of such Shares. In the event the Company elects to limit the number of Shares 
repurchased on such date to 10% of the Net Asset Value of the Fund, a Shareholder may not be 
able to repurchase on such Dealing Day all the Shares that it desires to repurchase. Investors 
should review this Prospectus and the relevant Supplement to ascertain whether and how such 
 provisions apply. 
 Repurchase Notice and Certifications 
If the Shares are subject to provisions concerning delivery of a repurchase notice, as mentioned 
under “Share Dealings - Repurchase of Shares” of this Prospectus and/or in the relevant 
Supplement, and such notice is received by the Administrator after the Dealing Deadline, it will not 
be deemed to be duly delivered until the next following Dealing Day. Such delay may increase or 
decrease the Repurchase Price from what it would have been but for such late delivery of the 
repurchase notice. The failure to deliver any repurchase documentation required could result in the 
loss or inability to receive amounts or deliveries otherwise due under the Shares. Investors should 
review this Prospectus and the relevant Supplement to ascertain whether and how such provisions 
 apply to the Shares. 
 Market Disruption Events & Settlement Disruption Events 
A determination of a market disruption event or a settlement disruption event in connection with 
any Fund Assets or Underlying (as may be further described in any Supplement) may have an 
effect on the value of the Shares and, may delay the occurrence of a Scheduled Maturity Date 
 and/or may delay settlement in respect of the Fund Assets, Underlying and/or the Shares.

 Potential Conflicts of Interest  
The Directors, the Investment Manager, the Depositary, the Administrator, the Index Sponsor, the 
Distributor, the Sub-Distributors, any Shareholder, any market maker which has been appointed to 
offer prices for the Shares on any exchange on which the Classes to which the Shares belong are 
listed (for the purposes hereof, a Market Maker) and any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, 
associates, agents or delegates (for the purposes hereof, Connected Persons and each a 
 Connected Person) may: 
1. 
contract or enter into any financial, banking or other transactions or arrangements with one 
another or with the Company including, without limitation, investment by the Company in 
securities or investment by any Connected Persons in any company or body any of whose 
investments form part of the assets of the Company or be interested in any such contracts 
or transactions; 
 
2. 
invest in and deal with Shares, securities, assets or any property of the kind included in 
the property of the Company for their respective individual accounts or for the account of 
a third party; and 
 
3. 
deal as agent or principal in the sale or purchase of securities and other investments to or 
from the Company through or with any Connected Person. 
 
Any assets of the Company in the form of cash or securities may be deposited with any Connected 
Person. Any assets of the Company in the form of cash may be invested in certificates of deposit 
or banking investments issued by any Connected Person. Banking or similar transactions may also 
 be undertaken with or through a Connected Person. 
In addition, in many cases an Approved Counterparty may be required to provide valuations in 
respect of a Derivative Contract between the Company and such Approved Counterparty. These 
valuations may form the basis upon which the value of certain assets of the Company is calculated. 
The Directors acknowledges that an Approved Counterparty may have a potential conflict of 
interest by virtue of acting as an Approved Counterparty and/or providing such valuations. However, 
the Directors believe that such conflicts can be adequately managed, and expect that the relevant 
Approved Counterparty will be suitable and competent to provide such valuations and will do so at 
no further cost to the Company which would be the case if the services of a third party were 
 engaged to provide valuations. 
Barclays Bank PLC or one of its Affiliates acts as the Investment Manager, the Distributor 
and may also act as the Index Sponsor, the Market Maker and/or the sub-custodian to the 
Company all in accordance with the relevant agreements which are in place. The Directors 
acknowledge that, by virtue of the functions which Barclays Bank PLC and/or its Affiliate 
will perform in connection with the Company, potential conflicts of interest are likely to arise. 
In such circumstances, each of Barclays Bank PLC and the Affiliate has undertaken to use 
its reasonable endeavours to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to 
its respective obligations and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the Company and 
the Shareholders are not unfairly prejudiced. The Directors believes that Barclays Bank PLC 
 and/or the Affiliate are suitable and competent to perform such functions. 
The Company will disclose to the Shareholders the situations in which the organisational or 
administrative arrangements made by the Company for the management of conflicts of interest 
were not sufficient to ensure that risks of damage to the interests of the Company or of its 
Shareholders will be prevented. This communication will be done through the periodical information 
  sent to Shareholders and also within the periodical financial reports issued by the Company. 

 <Page59>

 Taxation 
Investors in the Shares should be aware that they may be required to pay income tax, withholding 
tax, capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp taxes or any other kind of tax on distributions or deemed 
distributions of the Fund, capital gains within the Fund, whether or not realised, income received 
or accrued or deemed received within the Fund etc., and this will be according to the laws and 
practices of the country where the Shares are purchased, sold, held or redeemed and in the country 
 of residence or nationality of the Shareholder. 
Investors should be aware of the fact that they might have to pay taxes on income or deemed 
income received by or accrued within a Fund. Taxes might be calculated based on income received 
and/or deemed to be received and/or accrued in the Fund in relation to the Fund Assets, whereas 
the performance of the Fund, and subsequently the return investors receive after redemption of the 
Shares, might partially or fully depend on the performance of the Underlying. This can have the 
effect that the investor has to pay taxes for income or/and a performance which he does not, or 
 does not fully, receive. 
Investors who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their own independent tax 
advisors. In addition, investors should be aware that tax regulations and their application or 
interpretation by the relevant tax authorities’ change from time to time. Accordingly, it is not possible 
 to predict the precise tax treatment, which will apply at any given time. 
 FATCA 
Under the terms of the FATCA Law (as defined below), the Company is likely to be treated as a 
Reporting Luxembourg Financial Institution. As such, the Company may require all investors to 
provide documentary evidence of their tax residence and all other information deemed necessary 
to comply with the above mentioned regulations. Should the Company become subject to a 
withholding tax and/or penalties as a result of a non- compliance under the FATCA Law, the value 
 of the Shares held by Shareholders may be materially affected. 
Furthermore, the Company may also be required to withhold tax on certain payments to its 
Shareholders who would not be compliant with FATCA (i.e. the so-called foreign passthru 
 payments withholding tax obligation). 
 Common Reporting Standards 
The Company may be subject to the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account 
Information in Tax Matters (the “Standard”) and its Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS”) as 
 set out in Luxembourg law on the Common Reporting Standard (the “CRS Law”). 
Under the terms of the CRS Law, the Company is likely to be treated as a Luxembourg Reporting 
 Financial Institution.  
As such, as of 30 June 2017 and without prejudice to other applicable data protection provisions 
as set out in the Company documentation, the Company will be required to annually report to the 
Luxembourg tax authority personal and financial information related, inter alia, to the identification 
of, holdings by and payments made to (i) certain investors as per the CRS Law (the “Reportable 
Persons”) and (ii) Controlling Persons of certain non-financial entities (“NFEs”) which are 
themselves Reportable Persons. This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS 
 Law (the “Information”), will include personal data related to the Reportable Persons.  
The Company’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each 
investor providing the Company with the Information, along with the required supporting 
documentary evidence. In this context, the investors are hereby informed that, as data controller, 
the Company will process the Information for the purposes as set out in the CRS Law. The investors 

 <Page60>  
 
60 
 
undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the processing of their Information 
 by the Company. 
The investors are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons within the 
meaning of the CRS Law will be disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authority annually for the 
 purposes set out in the CRS Law.  
In particular, Reportable Persons are informed that certain operations performed by them will be 
reported to them through the issuance of statements, and that part of this information will serve as 
 a basis for the annual disclosure to the Luxembourg tax authority. 
Similarly, the investors undertake to inform the Company within thirty (30) days of receipt of these 
 statements should any included personal data not be accurate.  
The investors further undertake to immediately inform the Company of, and provide the Company 
with all supporting documentary evidence of any changes related to the Information after 
 occurrence of such changes. 
Any investor that fails to comply with the Company’s Information or documentation requests may 
be held liable for penalties imposed on the Company and attributable to such investor’s failure to 
provide the Information or subject to disclosure of the Information by the Company to the 
 Luxembourg tax authority. 
 Change of Law 
The Company must comply with regulatory constraints, such as a change in the laws affecting the 
Investment Restrictions, which might require a change in the investment policy and objectives 
 followed by a Fund. 
 Political Factors 
The performance of the Shares or the possibility to purchase, sell, or repurchase may be affected 
by changes in general economic conditions and uncertainties such as political developments, 
changes in government policies, the imposition of restrictions on the transfer of capital and changes 
 in regulatory requirements. 
 Epidemics / Pandemics / Outbreaks 
The performance of the Shares depends on the performance of the investments of the Funds, 
which could also be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks of 
communicable diseases. In response to intensifying efforts to contain epidemics, pandemics or 
outbreaks of communicable diseases, governments around the world may take a number of actions, 
such as prohibiting residents’ freedom of movement, encouraging or ordering employees to work 
remotely from home, and banning public activities and events, among others. Any prolonged 
disruption of businesses could negatively impact financial conditions. The performance of the 
Shares could be adversely affected to the extent that any of these epidemics, pandemics or 
 outbreaks harms the economy in general. 
 Liability for Fees and Expenses 
The fees and expenses relating to a Fund will be paid by the Company out of the assets of the 
 relevant Fund as set out in the relevant Supplement. However, to the extent that: 
(a) 
the arrangements, including any Fixed Fee Arrangement, for funding the payment by the 
Company of the fees and expenses do not generate the necessary funds to discharge all 
of the Company's liabilities in respect of the Fund; or 

 <Page61>  
 
61 
 
 
(b) 
the Company incurs any fees, expenses or other liabilities which are not budgeted for by 
the Company and accordingly fall outside the scope of the arrangements referred to in (a) 
above, 
 
the Company will pay such fees, expenses or liabilities from the Funds’ assets. The Company's 
liability in respect of such amounts will be borne by the relevant Fund as more fully described under 
 “Cross Liability between Classes” below. 
 Cross Liability between Classes 
 Allocation of shortfalls among Classes of a Fund 
The right of holders of any Class of Shares to participate in the assets of the Company is limited to 
the assets (if any) of the relevant Fund and all the assets comprising a Fund will be available to 
meet all of the liabilities of the Fund, regardless of the different amounts stated to be payable on 
 the separate Classes (as set out in the relevant Supplement). 
For example, if (i) on a winding-up of the Company or (ii) as at the Scheduled Maturity Date (if any), 
the amounts received by the Company under the relevant Fund Assets (after payment of all fees, 
expenses and other liabilities which are to be borne by the relevant Fund) are insufficient to pay 
the full Repurchase Proceeds payable in respect of all Classes of Shares of the relevant Fund, 
each Class of Shares of the Fund will rank pari passu with each other Class of Shares of the 
relevant Fund, and the proceeds of the relevant Fund will be distributed equally amongst each 
Shareholder of that Fund pro rata to the amount paid up on the Shares held by each Shareholder. 
The relevant Shareholders will have no further right of payment in respect of their Shares or any 
 claim against any other Fund or any other assets of the Company. 
This may mean that the overall return (taking account of any dividends already paid) to 
Shareholders who hold Shares paying dividends quarterly or more frequently may be higher than 
the overall return to Shareholders who hold Shares paying dividends annually and that the overall 
return to Shareholders who hold Shares paying dividends may be higher than the overall return to 
 Shareholders who hold Shares paying no dividends. 
In practice, cross liability between Classes is only likely to arise where the aggregate amounts 
payable in respect of any Class exceed the assets of the Fund notionally allocated to that Class, 
that is, those amounts (if any) received by the Company under the relevant Fund Assets (after 
payment of all fees, expenses and other liabilities which are to be borne by such Fund) that are 
intended to fund payments in respect of such Class or are otherwise attributable to that Class. Such 
a situation could arise if, for example, there is a default by an Approved Counterparty in respect of 
the relevant Fund Assets or in the circumstances described under “Liability for Fees and Expenses” 
above. In these circumstances, the remaining assets of the Fund notionally allocated to any other 
Class of the same Fund may be available to meet such payments and may accordingly not be 
 available to meet any amounts that otherwise would have been payable on such other Class. 
 Consequences of winding-up proceedings 
If the Company fails for any reason to meet its obligations or liabilities, or is unable to pay its debts, 
a creditor may be entitled to make an application for the winding-up of the Company. The 
commencement of such proceedings may entitle creditors (including Approved Counterparties) to 
terminate contracts with the Company (including Fund Assets) and claim damages for any loss 
arising from such early termination. The commencement of such proceedings may result in the 
Company being dissolved at a time and its assets (including the assets of all Funds) being realised 
and applied to pay the fees and expenses of the appointed liquidator or other insolvency officer, 
then in satisfaction of debts preferred by law and then in payment of the Company's liabilities, 

 <Page62>  
 
62 
 
before any surplus is distributed to the shareholders of the Company. In the event of proceedings 
being commenced, the Company may not be able to pay, in full or at all, the amounts anticipated 
 by the Supplement in respect of any Class or Funds. 
 Nominee Arrangements 
Where the Distributor and/or a nominee service provider is used by an investor to invest in the 
Shares of any Class or such investor holds interests in Shares of any Class through accounts with 
a Clearing System (such as Euroclear or Clearstream Luxembourg), such investor will only receive 
payments in respect of Repurchase Proceeds and/or any dividends attributable to the Shares on 
the basis of the arrangements entered into by the investor with the Distributor, nominee service 
provider or Clearing System, as the case may be. Furthermore, any such investor will not appear 
on the Register of the Company, will have no direct right of recourse against the Company and 
must look exclusively to the Distributor, nominee service provider or Clearing System for all 
payments attributable to the relevant Shares. The Company and the Directors will recognise as 
Shareholders only those persons who are at any time shown on the Register for the purposes of: 
(i) the payment of dividends and other payments due to be made to Shareholders (as applicable); 
(ii) the circulation of documents to Shareholders; (iii) the attendance and voting by Shareholders at 
any meetings of Shareholders; and (iv) all other rights of Shareholders attributable to the Shares. 
None of the Company, the Directors, the Investment Manager, the Administrator, the Depositary 
or any other person will be responsible for the acts or omissions of the Distributor, nominee service 
provider or Clearing System, nor make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to 
 the services provided by the Distributor, nominee service provider or Clearing System. 
The Company draws the investors’ attention to the fact that any investor will only be able to fully 
exercise his investor rights directly against the Company, notably the right to participate in general 
shareholders’ meetings if the investor is registered himself and in his own name in the shareholders’ 
register. In cases where an investor invests in the Company through an intermediary investing into 
the Company in his own name but on behalf of the investor, it may not always be possible for the 
investor to exercise certain shareholder rights directly against the Company. Investors are advised 
 to take advice on their rights.

company agreement, as amended from time to time, between the Company and the Management 
 Company (the "Management Company Agreement").  
The Management Company is organised under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg as a 
public limited company. It is authorised by the CSSF to act as chapter 15 Management Company 
 pursuant to the Law.  
The Management Company is registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register 
(Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés de Luxembourg) under number B 104.196. The share 
capital of the Management Company currently amounts to ten million Euro (EUR 10,000,000.-), all 
 fully subscribed and paid-up. 
The Management Company has a board of directors which, at the date of this Prospectus, consists 
 of the following members: 
(a)

Luxembourg 
(b) 
Thibault Gregoire, Executive Director – Chief Financial Officer, FundRock 
Management Company S.A., Luxembourg 
(c) 
Mr Romain Denis, Executive Director – Managing Director, FundRock Management 
Company S.A., Luxembourg 
(d)

 <Page65>  
 
65 
 
 affairs of the Company as further described in the Management Company Agreement. 
The Management Company shall be entitled to delegate all or part of the above duties to any person 
 or entity, which it will consider appropriate, as further detailed below. 
The Management Company will monitor the activities of the third parties to which it has delegated 
functions on a continued basis. The agreements entered between the Management Company and 
the relevant third parties provide that the Management Company can give further instructions to 
such third parties, and that it can withdraw their mandate with immediate effect if this is in the 
interest of the Shareholders at any time. The Management Company's liability towards the Fund is 
 not affected by the fact that it has delegated certain functions to third parties. 
The Management Company also acts as management company for other investment funds. The 
names of these other funds are available upon request at the registered office of the Management 
 Company. 
The Management Company has established and applies a remuneration policy in accordance with 
principles laid out under the UCITS Directive and any related legal and regulatory provisions 
 applicable in Luxembourg. 
The remuneration policy is aligned with the business strategy, objectives, values and interests of 
the Management Company and the UCITS that it manages and of the investors in such UCITS, 
and which includes, inter alia, measures to avoid conflicts of interest; and it is consistent with and 
promotes sound and effective risk management and does not encourage risk taking which is 
inconsistent with the risk profiles, rules or instruments of incorporation of the UCITS that the 
 Management Company manages. 
As an independent management company relying on a full-delegation model (i.e. delegation of the 
collective portfolio management function), the Management Company ensures that its 
remuneration policy adequately reflects the predominance of its oversight activity within its core 
activities. As such, it should be noted that the Management Company’s employees who are 
identified as risk-takers under the UCITS Directive are not remunerated based on the performance 
 of the UCITS under management.  
The Management Company’s remuneration policy, in a multi-year framework, ensures a balanced 
regime where remuneration both drives and rewards the performance of its employees in a 
 measured, fair and well-thought-out fashion, which relies on the following principles* : 
- 
Identification of the persons responsible for awarding remuneration and benefits (under the 
supervision of the remuneration committee and subject to the control of an independent 
internal audit committee); 
- 
Identification of the functions performed within the Management Company which may 
impact the performance of the entities under management;  
- 
Calculation of remuneration and benefits based on the combination of individual and 
company’s performance assessment; 
- 
Determination of a balanced remuneration (fixed and variable); 
- 
Implementation of an appropriate retention policy with regards to financial instruments used 
as variable remuneration; 
- 
Deferral of variable remuneration over 3-year periods; and 
- 
Implementation of control procedures/adequate contractual arrangements on the 
remuneration guidelines set up by the Management Company’s respective portfolio 
management delegates. 
 
*It should be noted that, upon issuance of final regulatory guidelines, this remuneration policy may 
 be subject to certain amendments and/or adjustments.

 Investment Manager 
The Management Company has, unless specifically stated in the Supplement for the relevant Fund, 
appointed Barclays Bank PLC, acting through its Barclays Investment Managers division (“BIM”), 
to provide certain investment related services to the Company. BIM’s principal activity is the 
provision of investment management services. Barclays Bank PLC is authorised by the PRA and 
 regulated by the FCA and the PRA. 
As further specified in the Investment Manager Agreement the delegation of the discretionary 
investment management to any sub-investment manager is subject to the prior consent of the 
Company and the prior non-objection of the Management Company and, to the extent necessary, 
 prior regulatory approval.  
 Distributor 
The Management Company has appointed Barclays Bank PLC as its principal distributor (the 
“Distributor”) pursuant to a distribution agreement, as amended from time to time, between the 
Company, the Management Company and the Distributor (the “Distribution Agreement”). The 
Distributor has power under the distribution agreement to appoint sub-distributors, sales agents 
and /or intermediaries upon countersignature by the Management Company of a non-objection 
request sent by the Distributor to the Management Company, as further specified in the Distribution 
 Agreement.  
The Management Company may seek to appoint various Barclays Bank PLC offices and 
subsidiaries and other entities as additional distributors. Such additional distributors may appoint 
 sub-distributors or intermediaries.  
 Depositary 
Under a depositary agreement dated as of 22 July 2017 (the “Depositary Agreement”), Northern 
 Trust Global Services SE has undertaken to provide depositary services for the Company’s assets. 
The Depositary, a European company (Societas Europaea) established under the laws of 
Luxembourg, with registered office at 10, rue du Château d’Eau, L-3364 Leudelange, Grand-Duchy 
of Luxembourg, is registered with the CSSF as a credit institution, authorised in Luxembourg 
according to the Luxembourg law of 5 April 1993 on the financial sector as amended from time to 
time, and registered with the Luxembourg register of commerce and companies (Registre de 
Commerce et des Sociétés) under number B 232.281. The Depositary’s ultimate holding company 
is Northern Trust Corporation, a company which is incorporated in the State of Illinois, United States 
 of America. 
Under the terms of the Depositary Agreement, the Depositary is entrusted with the safe-keeping of 
the Company’s assets. All financial instruments that can be held in custody are registered in the 
Depositary’s books within segregated accounts, opened in the name of the Company, in respect of 
each Fund. For other assets than financial instruments and cash, the Depositary must verify the 
ownership and keep a record of such assets by the Company in respect of each Fund. Furthermore, 
  the Depositary shall ensure that the Company’s cash flows are properly monitored.  

 <Page67>  
 
67 
 
 The Depositary will also, in accordance with the Luxembourg laws and the Depositary Agreement: 
 
ensure that the sale, issue, conversion, repurchase and cancellation of the Shares are 
carried out in accordance with the Luxembourg laws and the Articles of Incorporation; 
 
ensure that the value of the Shares is calculated in accordance with Luxembourg laws and 
with the Articles; 
 
carry out the instructions of the Company or of the Management Company, as the case 
may be, unless they conflict with Luxembourg laws or with the Articles of Incorporation; 
 
ensure that in transactions involving the assets of the Company, the consideration is 
remitted to it within the usual time limits; 
 
ensure that the income of the Company is applied in accordance with the Luxembourg laws 
and the Articles; and 
 
arrange for the payment of dividends on the Shares of the Company, upon instructions 
from the Company. 
Under the terms of the Depositary Agreement, the Depositary may delegate its safekeeping 
obligations provided that (i) the services are not delegated with the intention of avoiding the 
requirements of the UCITS Regulations, (ii) the Depositary can demonstrate that there is an 
objective reason for the delegation and (iii) it has exercised all due, skill, care and diligence in the 
selection and appointment of any third party to whom it wants to delegate parts of the Services, 
and keeps exercising all due skill, care and diligence in the periodic review and ongoing monitoring 
of any third party to whom it has delegated parts of its safekeeping services and of the 
arrangements of the third party in respect of the matters delegated to it. The liability of the 
Depositary will not be affected by virtue of any such delegation. The Depositary can delegate to 
sub-delegates responsibility for the safekeeping of the Company's financial instruments and cash. 
A complete list of all sub-delegates may be obtained, free of charge and upon request, from the 
Depositary 
and 
at 
the 
following 
webpage: 
 www.atlasmarketinteractive.com/GlobalMarketsandSubcustodiansListing. 
Where the law of a third country requires that financial instruments are held in custody by a local 
entity and no local entity satisfies the delegation requirements of the UCITS Regulations, the 
Depositary may delegate its functions to such local entity to the extent required by the law of that 
third country for as long as there are no local entities satisfying the aforementioned requirements. 
An up-to-date list of these countries, the reasons for the delegation as well as a description of the 
 risks resulting from such delegation can be found at the registered office of the Company. 
The Depositary Agreement provides that the Depositary shall be liable (i) in respect of a loss of a 
financial instrument held in its custody (or that of its duly appointed delegate) unless it can prove 
that the loss has arisen as a result of an external event beyond the Depositary’s reasonable control, 
the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable measures to the 
contrary, and (ii) in respect of all other losses as a result of the Depositary’s negligent or intentional 
 failure to properly fulfil its obligations pursuant to the UCITS Regulations. 
The Depositary Agreement dated 22 July 2017 has been entered into by the Company, the 
Management Company and the Depositary under which the Depositary has been appointed as 
depositary of the Company’s assets, subject to the overall supervision of the Directors. The 
Depositary Agreement provides that the appointment of the Depositary will continue unless and 
until terminated by the Company or the Depositary giving to the other party(ies) not less than six 
months prior written notice. The Depositary Agreement contains certain indemnities in favour of the 
Depositary (and each of its officers, employees and delegates) which are restricted to exclude 
matters arising by reason of the negligent or intentional failure of the Depositary in the performance 
 of its duties. 
The Depositary and its affiliate companies provide a variety of services to their clients including 

 <Page68>  
 
68 
 
 those clients for whom the Depositary acts as depositary. 
Accordingly, potential conflicts of interests may arise which must be appropriately identified, 
managed and disclosed. In order to meet such regulatory requirements in relation to such conflicts 
of interests, the Depositary has in place procedures which ensure that it is acting in the best 
interests of the Shareholders. A key element of ensuring the Depositary acts in the best interests 
of investors is the operational and organisational separation between the depositary function and 
 the other services provided by the Depositary’s affiliates. 
It is therefore possible that the Depositary (or any of its affiliates) and/or its sub-delegates may in 
the course of its or their business be involved in other financial and professional activities which 
may on occasion have potential conflicts of interest with those of the Company and/or other entities 
 for which the Depositary (or any of its affiliates) acts. 
Notwithstanding whether an affiliate company or a third party sub-custodian has been appointed, 
the Depositary has undertaken and shall undertake regular due diligence reviews on such sub-
custodians utilising identical standard questionnaires and checklists allowing it to manage any 
 conflicts of interests that may potentially arise. 
The Depositary does not anticipate that there would be any specific conflicts of interest arising as 
 a result of any delegation to any of the sub-delegates. 
If however a conflict of interests arises, the Depositary will have regard in such event to its 
obligations under the Depositary Agreement and the UCITS Directive and the Delegated 
Regulation and, in particular, will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the performance of its 
duties will not be impaired by any such involvement it may have and that any conflicts which may 
arise will be resolved fairly and in the best interests of Shareholders collectively so far as practicable, 
 having regard to its obligations to other clients. 
Where the arrangements under the conflicts of interests policies are not sufficient to manage a 
particular conflict, the Depositary will inform the Company of the nature of the conflict so the 
 Company can choose whether to continue to do business with the Depositary. 
Any of the information disclosed with regard to the Depositary may be updated from time to time 
 and such up-to-date information is available to investors upon request in writing from the Depositary.  
 Administrator 
The Management Company has appointed Northern Trust Global Services SE as administrator, 
registrar, transfer, corporate and domiciliary agent, pursuant to an amended and restated central 
administration services agreement, as amended from time to time, between the Company, the 
Management Company and the Administrator (the "Administration Agreement"). The 
Administrator will have the responsibility for the administration of the Company's affairs including 
the calculation of the Net Asset Value and preparation of the accounts of the Company, subject to 
 the overall supervision of the Management Company. 
Northern Trust Global Services SE is incorporated in the form of a European company (Societas 
Europaea) under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and is regulated by the CSSF as a 
credit institution. Its registered office is at 10, rue du Château d’Eau, L-3364 Leudelange, Grand 
Duchy of Luxembourg, and its ultimate holding company is Northern Trust Corporation which is 
 incorporated in the United States of America.  
In order to fulfil its role, the Administrator has entered into outsourcing arrangements with third party 
service providers being affiliates from the Northern Trust group (the “Sub-contractors”) (more 
information 
on 
these 
Sub-contractors 
can 
be 
found 
on 
the 
following 
website 
https://locations.northerntrust.com/index.html). (As part of these outsourcing arrangements, the 

 <Page69>  
 
69 
 
Administrator may be required to disclose and transfer personal and confidential information and 
documents about shareholders and individuals related to the shareholders (the “Related 
Individuals”) such as identification data – including the shareholder and/or the Related Individual’s 
name, address, national identifiers, date and country of birth, etc. account information, contractual 
and other documentation and transaction information) (the “Confidential Information”) to the Sub-
contractors (the “Data Transfer”). In accordance with Luxembourg law, the Administrator is 
required to provide a certain level of information about those outsourcing arrangements to the Fund, 
 which, in turn, must be provided by Fund to the shareholders. 
A description of the purposes of the outsourcing arrangements, the Confidential Information that 
may be transferred to Sub-contractors thereunder, as well as the country where those Sub-
 contractors are located is set out below: 
Type of Confidential 
Information transmitted to 
the Sub-contractors 
Country where the Sub-
contractors are established 
Nature of the outsourced 
activities 
Confidential Information (as 
defined above) 
Ireland 
India 
• set-up and maintenance of 
 fund static data; 
• set-up and maintenance of 
 investor static data; 
• performance 
of 
risk 
assessment and AML due 
diligence 
on 
investors, 
including 
the 
ongoing 
monitoring and processing 
of overnight PEP, sanction 
and Adverse Media alerts; 
 
Confidential Information may be transferred to Sub-contractors established in countries where 
professional secrecy or confidentiality obligations are not equivalent to the Luxembourg 
professional secrecy obligations applicable to the Administrator. In any event, the Administrator is 
legally bound to, and has committed to the Fund that it will enter into outsourcing arrangements 
with Sub-contractors which are either subject to professional secrecy obligations by application of 
law or which will be contractually bound to comply with strict confidentiality rules. The Administrator 
has further committed to the Fund that it will take reasonable technical and organisational measures 
to ensure the confidentiality of the Confidential Information subject to the Data Transfer and to 
protect Confidential Information against unauthorised processing. Confidential Information will 
therefore only be accessible to a limited number of persons within the relevant Sub-contractor, on 
“a need to know” basis and following the principle of the “least privilege”. Unless otherwise 
authorised/required by law, or in order to comply with requests from national or foreign regulatory 
authorities or law enforcement authorities, the relevant Confidential Information will not be 
 transferred to entities other than the Sub-contractors. 
By subscribing to Shares of the Fund, each Shareholder has consented and agreed to the 
 communication of the Confidential Information by the Administrator to the Sub-contractors.

 Potential Conflicts of Interest 
The Directors, the Management Company, the Investment Manager, any investment adviser, the 
Depositary, the Administrator, the Index Sponsor, the Distributor, the Sub-Distributors, any 
Shareholder, any market maker which has been appointed to offer prices for the Shares on any 
exchange on which the Classes to which the Shares belong are listed (for the purposes hereof, a 
“Market Maker”) and any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, associates, agents or delegates 
 (for the purposes hereof, "Connected Persons" and each a "Connected Person") may: 
• 
contract or enter into any financial, banking or other transactions or arrangements with one 
another or with the Company including, without limitation, investment by the Company in 
securities or investment by any Connected Persons in any company or body any of whose 
investments form part of the assets of the Company or be interested in any such contracts 
or transactions; 
• 
invest in and deal with Shares, securities, assets or any property of the kind included in the 
property of the Company for their respective individual accounts or for the account of a 
third party; and 
• 
deal as agent or principal in the sale or purchase of securities and other investments to or 
from the Company through or with the Management Company, the Investment Manager or 
the Depositary or any subsidiary, affiliate, associate, agent or delegate thereof. 
 
Any assets of the Company in the form of cash or securities may be deposited with any Connected 
Person. Any assets of the Company in the form of cash may be invested in certificates of deposit 
or banking investments issued by any Connected Person. Banking or similar transactions may also 
 be undertaken with or through a Connected Person. 
Entities within, and/or employees, agents, affiliates or subsidiaries of members of, the Barclays 
Bank PLC (for the purposes hereof, collectively, “Barclays Affiliates”) may be an Approved 
 Counterparty to the derivatives transactions or contracts entered into by the Company. 
In addition, in many cases an Approved Counterparty may be required to provide valuations of such 
derivative transactions or contracts between the Company and such Approved Counterparty. 
These valuations may form the basis upon which the value of certain assets of the Company is 
calculated. The Board of Directors acknowledges that an Approved Counterparty may have a 
potential conflict of interest by virtue of acting as an Approved Counterparty and/or providing such 
valuations. However, the Directors believe that such conflicts can be adequately managed, and 
expect that the Approved Counterparty will be suitable and competent to provide such valuations 
and will do so at no further cost to the Company which would be the case if the services of a third 
party were engaged to provide valuations. To the extent that Barclays Bank PLC acts as an 
Approved Counterparty and provides such valuations, the operational risks arising from any such 
potential lack of independence are in part reduced by the fact that different divisions within Barclays 
 Bank PLC will be responsible for the different roles. 
Barclays Affiliates may also act as Director, Distributor, Sub-Distributor, Index Sponsor, Market 
Maker, and Investment Manager and provide sub-custodian services to the Company all in 
accordance with the relevant agreements which are in place. The Board of Directors acknowledges 

 <Page71>  
 
71 
 
that, by virtue of the functions which Barclays Affiliates will perform in connection with the Company, 
potential conflicts of interest are likely to arise. In such circumstances, each Barclays Affiliate has 
undertaken to use its or his reasonable endeavours to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly 
(having regard to its or his respective obligations and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the 
Company and the Shareholders are not unfairly prejudiced. The Board of Directors believes that 
 such Barclays Affiliates are suitable and competent to perform such functions. 
An Investment Manager may also, in the course of its business, have potential conflicts of interest 
with the Company in circumstances other than those referred to above. The Investment Manager 
will, however, have regard in such event to its obligations under the relevant Investment 
Management Agreement and, in particular, to its obligations to act in the best interests of the 
Company so far as practicable, having regard to its obligations to other clients when undertaking 
any investments where conflicts of interest may arise and will ensure that such conflicts are 
resolved fairly as between the Company, the relevant Funds and other clients. The Investment 
Manager will ensure that investment opportunities are allocated on a fair and equitable basis 
between the Company and its other clients. In the event that a conflict of interest does arise the 
 directors of the Investment Manager will endeavour to ensure that such conflicts are resolved fairly. 
As the fees of an Investment Manager are based on the Net Asset Value of a Fund, if the Net Asset 
Value of the Fund increases so do the fees payable to the Investment Manager and accordingly 
there is a conflict of interest for the Investment Manager in cases where the Investment Manager 
 is responsible for determining the valuation price of a Fund’s investments. 
 Commissions and other arrangements 
An Investment Manager may effect transactions through the agency of another person with whom 
the Investment Manager has an arrangement under which that party will, from time to time, provide 
or procure for the Investment Manager goods, services or other benefits such as research and 
advisory services, computer hardware associated with specialised software or research services 
and performance measures etc. Under such arrangements, no direct payment is made for such 
services or benefits, but instead pursuant to an agreement, the Investment Manager undertakes to 
place business with that party. For the avoidance of doubt, such goods and services do not include 
travel, accommodation, entertainment, general administrative goods or services, general office 
equipment or premises, membership fees, employees’ salaries or direct money payments. In such 
case, the Investment Manager shall ensure that such arrangements shall assist in the provision of 
investment services to the relevant Fund and the broker/counterparty to the arrangement has 
agreed to provide best execution to the relevant Fund. Details of any such soft commission 
 arrangements will be disclosed in the periodic reports of the relevant Funds. 
Barclays Bank PLC or one of its Affiliates may be an Approved Counterparty to the Derivative 
Contracts entered into by the Company. Barclays Bank PLC or one of its Affiliates which may be 
an Approved Counterparty may also receive fees from third parties for holding securities or funds 
for the purpose of hedging the obligations under the Derivative Contracts. Barclays Bank PLC may 
 also enter fee sharing arrangements with third parties as part of its business and trading activities.

SHARE DEALINGS 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
Subscription for Shares 
 
 Subscription of Shares 
Under the Articles, the Board of Directors is given authority to effect the issue of Shares and to 
create new Classes of Shares (in accordance with the requirements of the Authority) and have 
absolute discretion to accept or reject in whole or in part any application for Shares based on the 
principle of equal treatment of Shareholders. If an application is rejected, either by the Board of 
Directors directly, or by the Management Company acting on its behalf, the Administrator at the 
risk of the applicant will return application monies or the balance thereof by electronic transfer to 
the account from which it was paid at the cost and risk of the applicant. For the avoidance of doubt, 
 no interest will be payable on such amount before its return to the applicant.  
The Board of Directors may in its discretion decide, prior to the Launch Date, to cancel the initial 
offering of Shares of any Class of a Fund. The Board of Directors may also decide to cancel the 
offering of a new Class of Shares of a Fund. In such case, applicants having made an application 
for subscription will be duly informed and any subscription monies already paid will be returned in 
the manner set out in the preceding paragraph. For the avoidance of doubt, no interest will be 
payable on such amount prior to their return to the investors. The Board of Directors also reserves 
the right to authorize at any time and without notice the issue and sale of Shares for Funds that 
were previously closed for further subscriptions. Such decision will be taken by the Board of 
 Directors with due regard to the interest of the existing Shareholders. 
The Launch Date and the Initial Offer Period (if any) for each newly created or activated Fund will 
 be determined by the Board of Directors and disclosed in the relevant Supplement. 
The Board of Directors may, at any time and in its discretion, resolve to close a Fund or one or 
more Share Classes to subscriptions or conversions for a period of time. The circumstances in 
which it may do so include, but are not limited to, circumstances where the strategy run by the 
Investment Manager, of which the Fund forms part, has reached a size where, in the opinion of the 
Investment Manager, the universe of securities in which the strategy may invest may become too 
small to enable the Investment Manager to continue to invest the assets of the strategy effectively 
if the Fund, and therefore the strategy, continues to grow. Such Funds may be re-opened at any 
 time by a resolution of the Board of Directors. 
In exercising the discretion provided above, the Board of Directors may, at any time, decide to close 
a Fund or a Share Class and not to accept any further investment into the relevant Fund or Share 
Class either from (i) investors who have not yet invested into the said Funds or into the said Share 
Classes (“Soft Closure”) or (ii) any investor including investors already invested in the relevant 
 Fund or Share Class (“Hard Closure”). 
Decisions taken by the Board of Directors on Soft Closure and Hard Closure may have immediate 
 or non-immediate effect and may be effective for an unspecified period of time. 
In relation thereto, information on the closure and re-opening of these Share Classes or Funds will 
 be available at the registered office of the Company. 
Fractions of Shares up to two decimal places may be issued. Subscription monies representing 
smaller fractions of Shares will not be returned to the applicant but will be retained as part of the 
assets of the relevant Fund and accordingly available to Shareholders of the Fund on a pro rata 
basis based on each Shareholder’s holding of Shares. 

 <Page73>

The Application Form contains certain conditions regarding the application procedure for Shares in 
the Company and certain indemnities in favour of the Company, the relevant Fund, the 
Administrator, the Depositary and the other Shareholders for any loss suffered by them as a result 
 of certain applicants acquiring or holding Shares. 
Any investor must have been provided with the key investor information documents of the relevant 
 Class of Shares prior to any subscription or conversion in the relevant Fund. 
 Direct Subscriptions via the Company 
Applications for the initial subscription of Shares should be submitted in writing or by facsimile to 
the Company care of the Administrator provided that an original Application Form (and supporting 
documentation in relation to money laundering / terrorist financing prevention checks) shall be 
 submitted and received promptly in the case of an initial application for Shares. 
Subsequent subscriptions for Shares in a Fund may be made by contacting the Administrator by 
telephone, by facsimile, in writing or by such other means as the Board of Directors (with the 
consent of the Administrator) may prescribe from time to time (where such means are in 
accordance with the requirements of the Authority). A Shareholder who places an order by 
telephone is deemed to have consented to the recording of such telephone order and must provide 
 the following information: 
• 
the Shareholder’s name and account number and the address and/or fax number 
to which the Contract Note is to be sent; 
 
• 
the Fund name and Class of Shares being subscribed for; 
 
• 
the amount of cash or Shares to be invested; 
 
• 
a statement as to how settlement will be made; and 
 
• 
confirmation that the application has been made in compliance with the terms and 
conditions of this Prospectus and the relevant Supplement. 
 
 This information will be confirmed to the Shareholder over a recorded telephone line. 
Telephone requests will only be processed provided that the Shareholder’s name and account 
number, and the name, address and/or fax number to which the Contract Note is to be sent 
corresponds to that listed as the Shareholder of record registered with the Administrator. Should 
the Shareholder designate that the Contract Note be sent to a name and/or address which differs 
from that registered with the Administrator, written confirmation of this change must be submitted 
 by the Shareholder and received by the Administrator before the order will be processed. 
The Administrator may request such identification documents as it deems necessary in order to 
comply with the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and applicable 
Regulations (the “Identification Requirements”). In the case of doubt as to the investor’s identity or 
in the absence of sufficient information to enable the Administrator to ascertain such identity, the 
latter may request further information and/or documents to enable it to ascertain with certainty such 
identity. If the investor refuses or fails to provide the requested information and/or documents, the 
Administrator may refuse to enter, or delay the entry of, the investor’s details on the Company’s 
shareholders’ register or may refuse to pay the proceeds of a redemption or any dividend. Any such 
information provided to the Administrator is collected for anti-money laundering and counter-
 terrorist financing compliance purposes only. 
In addition, the Administrator is under an obligation to identify the origin of the monies received 

 <Page74>  
 
74 
 
from a financial institution unless such financial institution is subject to an obligatory identification 
procedure equivalent to that required under Luxembourg law. Any subscriptions may be temporarily 
 suspended until the Administrator has properly identified the source of the monies. 
Subscriptions via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or Clearing 
 System 
Initial or subsequent subscriptions for Shares can also be made indirectly, that is through the 
Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System, for onward transmission 
to the Company care of the Administrator (the Distributor, Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or 
Clearing System must ensure that subscriptions are received by the Administrator by the relevant 
Dealing Deadline). In such case, the Administrator may, in its discretion, waive the Identification 
Requirements in the following circumstances or in such other circumstances which are regarded 
 as sufficient under current Luxembourg anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing rules: 
(a) 
if and when a subscription is made via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying 
agent or a Clearing System which is supervised by a regulatory authority which imposes a 
client identification obligation equivalent to that required under Luxembourg law for the 
prevention of money laundering / terrorist financing and to which the Distributor, the Sub-
Distributor, the local paying agent or the Clearing System is subject; 
 
(b) 
if and when a subscription is made via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying 
agent or a Clearing System whose parent is supervised by a regulatory authority imposing 
a client identification obligation equivalent to that required under Luxembourg law for the 
prevention of money laundering / terrorist financing and where the law applicable to the 
parent or the group policy imposes an equivalent obligation on its subsidiaries or branches. 
 
The Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System may provide a 
nominee service for investors purchasing Shares through them. Such investors may, at their 
discretion, elect to make use of such service pursuant to which the nominee will hold Shares in its 
name for and on behalf of the investors and who, in order to empower the nominee to vote at any 
general meeting of Shareholders, shall provide the nominee with specific or general voting 
instructions to that effect. Notwithstanding the above, the investors retain the ability to invest directly 
 in the Company, without using such nominee services. 
Shares may be issued to and registered in the name of a Clearing System (or its nominee) 
nominated by or on behalf of an investor, by the Distributor, the relevant Sub-Distributor or third 
party nominee service provider, the local paying agent, as the case may be, that is recognised and 
accepted by the Company. Accountholders may incur fees normally payable in respect of the 
 maintenance and operation of accounts in such Clearing System (or nominee). 
 Deferral of Subscriptions 
The Board of Directors may, in its absolute discretion, determine that in certain circumstances, it is 
detrimental for existing Shareholders to accept an application for Shares in cash or in specie, 
representing more than 5% of the Net Asset Value of a Fund. In such case, the Board of Directors 
may postpone the application and, in consultation with the relevant investor, either require such 
investor to stagger the proposed application over an agreed period of time, or establish an 
Investment Account outside the structure of the Company in which to invest the investor's 
subscription monies. Such Investment Account will be used to acquire the Shares over a pre-
agreed time schedule. The investor shall be liable for any transaction costs or reasonable expenses 
incurred in connection with the acquisition of such Shares. Any applicable Preliminary Charge will 
be deducted from the subscription monies before the investment of the subscription monies 
  commences. 

 <Page75>

 Processing of Direct Subscriptions to the Company 
Issuances of Shares will normally be made with effect from a Dealing Day in respect of applications 
received on or prior to the Dealing Deadline. Dealing Days and Dealing Deadlines relating to each 
Fund are specified in the relevant Supplement. Applications received after the Dealing Deadline for 
the relevant Dealing Day shall, unless the Administrator shall otherwise agree and provided they 
are received before the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day, be deemed to have been 
received by the next Dealing Deadline. Applications will be irrevocable unless the Directors, or a 
delegatee, otherwise agree. If requested, the Board of Directors may, in its absolute discretion and 
subject to the prior approval of the Administrator, agree to designate additional Dealing Days and 
Valuation Points for the purchase of Shares relating to any Fund which will be open to all 
 Shareholders. 
Processing of Subscriptions via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or 
 a Clearing System 
Different subscription procedures and time limits may apply if applications for Shares are made via 
the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System as the case may be 
although the ultimate deadlines with the Administrator referred to in the preceding paragraph 
remain unaffected. Full payment instructions for subscribing via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, 
a local paying agent or a Clearing System may be obtained through the Distributor, the relevant 
 Sub-Distributor, the local paying agent or a Clearing System as the case may be. 
None of the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System is permitted 
 to withhold subscription orders to benefit itself by a price change. 
Investors should note that they may be unable to purchase Shares via the Distributor, a Sub-
Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System on days that any such Distributor, Sub-
 Distributor, a local paying agent or Clearing System is not open for business. 
In circumstances in which the subscription proceeds are not received in a timely manner, the 
relevant allotment of Shares may be cancelled and the applicant may be required to compensate 
 the Company for any costs and expenses thereby created. 
Minimum Initial and Additional Investment Amount and Minimum Shareholding 
 Requirements 
The Minimum Initial Investment Amount, the Minimum Additional Investment Amount and the 
Minimum Shareholding of Shares of each Class of a Fund may vary and is set out in the 
Supplement for the relevant Fund. The Directors and the Management Company reserve the right 
from time to time to waive any requirements relating to the Minimum Initial Investment Amount, the 
Minimum Additional Investment Amount and the Minimum Shareholding as and when they 
 determine at their reasonable discretion based on the principle of equal treatment of Shareholders. 
The Company may, at any time, repurchase all Shares from Shareholders whose holding is less 
than the Minimum Shareholding. In such case the Shareholder concerned will receive prior notice 
so as to be able to increase his holding above such amounts during such period to be determined 
 by the Board of Directors (and set out in the notice) following the receipt of such notice. 
 Subscription Price 
During the Initial Offer Period for each Fund, the Initial Issue Price for Shares in the relevant Fund 
 shall be the amount set out in the Supplement for the relevant Fund. 
The issue price at which Shares of any Fund will be issued on a Dealing Day after the Initial Offer 
Period is calculated by ascertaining the Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant Class on the 

 <Page76>  
 
76 
 
 relevant Dealing Day. 
A Preliminary Charge of up to 6% of the Initial Issue Price or the Net Asset Value per Share, as 
appropriate may be charged by the Company for payment to the Distributor on the issue of Shares, 
out of which the Distributor may, for example, pay commission to Sub-Distributors and other 
financial intermediaries. The amount of the Preliminary Charge, if any, will be set out in the relevant 
 Supplement. 
 Payment for Shares 
Payment in respect of the issue of Shares must be made by the relevant Settlement Date by 
electronic transfer in cleared funds in the currency of denomination of the relevant Class of the 
Shares. Cheques will only be accepted in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the 
Administrator and by advance agreement. The Administrator may, at its discretion, accept payment 
in other currencies, but such payments will be converted into the currency of denomination of the 
relevant Class of the Shares at the then prevailing exchange rate available to the Administrator and 
only the net proceeds (after deducting the conversion expenses) will be applied towards payment 
 of the subscription moneys. This may result in a delay in processing the application. 
If payment in full has not been received by the Settlement Date, or in the event of non-clearance of 
funds, the allotment of Shares made in respect of such application may, at the discretion of the 
Administrator, be cancelled, or, alternatively, the Administrator may treat the application as an 
application for such number of Shares as may be purchased with such payment on the Dealing 
Day next following receipt of payment in full or of cleared funds. In such cases the Company may 
 charge the applicant for any resulting bank charges or market losses incurred by the relevant Fund. 
 In Specie Issues 
The Board of Directors may in its absolute discretion, provided that it is satisfied that no material 
prejudice would result to any existing Shareholder allot Shares of any Fund against the vesting in 
the Depositary on behalf of the relevant Fund of investments, the nature of which would qualify as 
suitable investments of the relevant Fund in accordance with the investment objective, policy and 
restrictions of the Fund. The number of Shares to be issued in this way shall be the number which 
would, on the day the investments are vested in the Depositary on behalf of the relevant Fund, 
have been issued for cash (together with the relevant Preliminary Charge) against the payment of 
a sum equal to the value of the investments. The value of the investments to be vested shall be 
calculated by applying the valuation methods described below under the heading “Calculation of 
 Net Asset Value/ Valuation of Assets”, in compliance with the Articles. 
 Limitations on Subscriptions 
Shares may not be issued or sold by the Company during any period when the calculation of the 
Net Asset Value of the relevant Fund is suspended in the manner described under “Suspension of 
Calculation of Net Asset Value” below. Applicants subscribing for Shares directly to the Company 
or the Administrator will be notified of such postponement and, unless withdrawn, their applications 
will be considered as at the next Dealing Day following the ending of such suspension. Applicants 
subscribing for Shares via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or applicants 
seeking to become accountholders through a Clearing System as the case may be have to contact 
directly the Distributor, the Sub-Distributor, the local paying agent or the relevant Clearing System 
for arrangements regarding application to be made or pending during such suspension period. 
Applications made or pending during such suspension period via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, 
a local paying agent or a Clearing System as the case may be, unless withdrawn, will be considered 
 as at the next Dealing Day following the end of such suspension. 
Shares may not be directly or indirectly offered or sold in the United States or purchased or held by 
or for U.S. Persons (unless permitted under certain exceptions under the laws of the United States). 

 <Page77>  
 
77 
 
 
 Anti-Dilution Levy 
The Board of Directors may, where there are large subscriptions, or any such subscriptions amount 
or threshold as specified in the relevant Supplement, adjust the Subscription Price by adding an 
Anti-Dilution Levy of up to 1%, or any such other percentage as specified in the relevant 
Supplement, of the amount of an individual subscription for retention as part of the assets of the 
relevant Fund, further details of which will be set out in the relevant Supplement. This Anti-Dilution 
 Levy will cover dealing costs and preserve the value of the assets of the relevant Fund. 
Repurchase of Shares 
 
 Procedure for Direct Repurchase 
Requests for the repurchase of Shares should be made to the Company care of the Administrator 
in writing, by facsimile, by telephone or by such other means as the Board of Directors may (with 
the consent of the Administrator) prescribe from time to time (where such means are in accordance 
with the requirements of the Authority) and must in the case of requests in writing or by facsimile 
quote the relevant account number, the relevant Fund(s), Class of Share and any other information 
which the Administrator reasonably requires, and be signed by or on behalf of the Shareholder 
before payment of Repurchase Proceeds can be made. Repurchase requests made by facsimile 
must be followed by subsequent confirmation in writing. A request by telephone may only be made 
if designated by the Shareholder on the account application. When making a redemption request 
 by telephone, the Shareholder must also provide the following information: 
• 
the Shareholder’s name and the account number and the address and/or fax 
number to which the Contract Note is to be sent; 
 
• 
the Class of Shares being repurchased; and 
 
• 
confirmation that the repurchase request has been made in compliance with the 
terms and conditions of this Prospectus and the relevant Supplement. 
 
 This information will be confirmed to the Shareholder over a recorded telephone line. 
Repurchase requests received by fax or telephone or such other means approved by the Board of 
Directors in accordance with the requirements of the Authority (with the consent of the Administrator) 
will only be processed provided that the Shareholder’s name and account number, and the name, 
address and/or fax number or applicable details to which the Contract Note is to be sent 
corresponds to that listed as the Shareholder of record registered with the Administrator. Should 
the Shareholder designate that the Contract Note be sent to the name and/or address which differs 
from that registered with the Administrator, written confirmation of this change must be submitted 
by the Shareholder and received by the Administrator (and the Administrator must have made the 
 amendments to the Shareholder’s registration details) before the order will be processed. 
 Processing of Direct Repurchases to the Company 
Requests received on or prior to the relevant Dealing Deadline will, subject as mentioned in this 
section and in the relevant Supplement, normally be dealt with on the relevant Dealing Day. 
Repurchase requests received after the Dealing Deadline shall, unless the Directors shall otherwise 
agree and provided they are received before the relevant Valuation Point, be treated as having 
been received by the following Dealing Deadline. Unless otherwise specified in this Prospectus, 
 applications will be irrevocable. 
In no event shall Redemption Proceeds be paid until the original Application Form has been 

 <Page78>  
 
78 
 
received from the investor and all of the necessary anti-money laundering checks have been carried 
 out. 
A repurchase request will not be capable of withdrawal after acceptance by the Administrator. If 
requested, the Board of Directors may, in its absolute discretion and subject to the prior approval 
of the Depositary, agree to designate additional Dealing Days and Valuation Points for the 
 repurchase of Shares relating to any Fund which will be open to all Shareholders. 
Repurchase Procedure with the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a 
 Clearing System 
The repurchase procedures and the dealing deadlines may be different if applications for 
repurchase are made to the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or through a 
Clearing System, although the ultimate Dealing Deadlines and procedures referred to above and 
in the relevant Supplement will remain unaffected. Applicants for repurchases may obtain 
information on the repurchase procedure directly from the Distributor, the relevant Sub-Distributor, 
a local paying agent or the relevant Clearing System as the case may be and should also refer to 
 the relevant Supplement. 
 Repurchase Size 
 An applicant may request the repurchase of all or part of its Shares of any Class of a Fund. 
 The Minimum Repurchase Amount may vary according to the Fund or the Class of Share. 
For Funds having a Scheduled Maturity Date, all Shares for which no repurchase request has been 
made in respect of this Scheduled Maturity Date, will be compulsorily repurchased on such 
Scheduled Maturity Date at the Net Asset Value per Share calculated on the relevant Dealing Day 
by reference to the Scheduled Maturity Date as further specified in the relevant Supplement. A 
Fund will have no Scheduled Maturity Date unless otherwise determined in the relevant 
Supplement. Funds for which no Scheduled Maturity Date has been designated may be closed in 
accordance with the procedures laid down in the Articles and Shares will be repurchased at the Net 
Asset Value per Share (taking into account actual realisation prices of investments and realisation 
 expenses) calculated on the Dealing Day at which such decision shall take effect. 
The Administrator may decline to effect a repurchase request which would have the effect of 
reducing the value of any holding of Shares relating to any Fund below the Minimum Shareholding 
for that Class of Shares of that Fund. Any repurchase request having such an effect may be treated 
by the Company or the Administrator as a request to repurchase the Shareholder’s entire holding 
 of that Class of Shares. 
The Administrator will not accept repurchase requests, which are incomplete, until all the necessary 
 information is obtained. 
 Repurchase Price 
The Repurchase Price at which Shares will be repurchased on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, less any applicable Repurchase 
Charge or Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. The method of establishing the Net Asset Value of 
any Fund and the Net Asset Value per Share of any Class of Shares in a Fund is set out in the 
Articles as described in this Prospectus under the heading “Calculation of Net Asset 
 Value/Valuation of Assets” below. 
 Payment of Repurchase Proceeds 
The amount due on repurchase of Shares will be paid by electronic transfer to the relevant 

 <Page79>  
 
79 
 
Shareholder’s account of record on the original Application Form in the currency of denomination 
of the relevant Class of Shares of the relevant Fund (or in such other currency as the Board of 
Directors shall determine) by the Settlement Date. Payment of Repurchase Proceeds will be made 
to the registered Shareholder or in favour of the joint registered Shareholders as appropriate. The 
Repurchase Proceeds of the Shares will only be paid on receipt by the Administrator of a 
repurchase request together with such other documentation that the Administrator may reasonably 
 require. 
 Limitations on Repurchases 
The Company may not repurchase Shares of any Fund during any period when the calculation of 
the Net Asset Value of the relevant Fund is suspended in the manner described under “Suspension 
of Calculation of Net Asset Value” below. Applicants for repurchases of Shares will be notified of 
such postponement and, unless withdrawn, their applications will be considered as at the next 
Dealing Day following the ending of such suspension. Applicants repurchasing Shares via the 
Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System as the case may be have 
to contact directly the Distributor, the Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or the relevant Clearing 
System for arrangements regarding repurchases to be made or pending during such suspension 
period. Applications made or pending during such suspension period via the Distributor, a Sub-
Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System as the case may be, unless withdrawn, will 
 be considered as at the next Dealing Day following the end of such suspension. 
The Board of Directors is entitled to limit the number of Shares in a Fund repurchased on any 
Dealing Day to Shares representing 10% of the total Net Asset Value of that Fund on that Dealing 
Day. In this event, the limitation will apply pro rata so that all Shareholders wishing to have Shares 
of that Fund repurchased on that Dealing Day realise the same proportion of such Shares. Shares 
not repurchased, but which would otherwise have been repurchased, will be carried forward for 
repurchase on the next Dealing Day(s) and will be dealt with in priority (on a rateable basis) to 
repurchase requests received subsequently. If requests for repurchase are so carried forward, the 
Administrator will inform the Shareholders affected. The procedure for carrying forward redemption 
 orders is further detailed in the Articles. 
 Mandatory Repurchases 
The Company may compulsorily repurchase all of the Shares of any Fund if the Net Asset Value 
of the relevant Fund is less than the Minimum Fund Size (if any) specified in the relevant 
 Supplement. 
The Company reserves the right to repurchase any Shares which are or become owned, directly 
or indirectly, by a U.S. Person (unless pursuant to an exemption under U.S. securities laws), by 
any individual under the age of 18 (or such other age as the Directors think fit) or if the holding of 
the Shares by any person is in breach of any law or requirement of any country or governmental 
authority or by virtue of which such person is not qualified to hold such Shares or might result in 
the Company incurring any liability to taxation or suffering other pecuniary legal or material 
administrative disadvantages which the Company might not otherwise have incurred, suffered or 
 breached. 
 Anti-Dilution Levy 
The Board of Directors may, where there are large repurchases, or any such repurchase amount 
or threshold as specified in the relevant Supplement, adjust the Repurchase Price by deducting an 
Anti-Dilution Levy of up to 1%, or any such other percentage as specified in the relevant 
Supplement, of the amount of an individual redemption for retention as part of the assets of the 
relevant Fund, further details of which will be set out in the relevant Supplement. This Anti-Dilution 
 Levy will cover dealing costs and preserve the value of the assets of the relevant Fund. 

 <Page80>

Exchange of Shares 
 
Shareholders will be able to apply to exchange on any Dealing Day all or part of their holding of 
Shares of any Class of any Fund (the “Original Class”) for Shares of another Class which are 
being offered at that time (the “New Class”) (such Class being of the same Fund or different Fund) 
provided that all the criteria for applying for Shares in the New Class have been met and by giving 
notice to the Administrator on or prior to the Dealing Deadline for the relevant Dealing Day. The 
Administrator may however at its discretion agree to accept requests for exchange received after 
the relevant Dealing Deadline provided they are received prior to the relevant Valuation Point. The 
general provisions and procedures relating to the issue and repurchase of Shares will apply equally 
to exchanges, save in relation to charges payable, details of which are set out below and in the 
 relevant Supplement. 
When requesting the exchange of Shares as an initial investment in a Fund, Shareholders should 
ensure that the value of the Shares exchanged is equal to, or exceeds, the Minimum Initial 
Investment Amount for the relevant New Class specified in the Supplement for the relevant Fund. 
In the case of an exchange of a partial holding only, the value of the remaining holding must also 
 be at least equal to the Minimum Shareholding for the Original Class. 
Shareholders should read the relevant key investor information document relating to their intended 
investment before converting their Shares and may be asked to declare that they have received an 
 up-to-date key investor information document. 
The number of Shares of the New Class to be issued will be calculated in accordance with the 
 following formula: 
 S = [R x (RP x ER)] – F 
SP 
 where: 
R 
= 
the number of Shares of the Original Class to be exchanged; 
 
S 
= 
the number of Shares of the New Class to be issued; 
 
RP 
= 
the Repurchase Price per Share of the Original Class as at the Valuation 
Point for the relevant Dealing Day; 
 
ER 
= 
in the case of an exchange of Shares designated in the same Base 
Currency, the value of ER is 1. In any other case, the value of ER is the 
currency conversion factor determined by the Directors at the Valuation 
Point for the relevant Dealing Day as representing the effective rate of 
exchange applicable to the transfer of assets relating to the Original and 
New Classes of Shares after adjusting such rate as may be necessary to 
reflect the effective costs of making such transfer; 
 
SP 
= 
the subscription price per Share of the New Class as at the Valuation Point 
for the applicable Dealing Day; and 
 
F 
= 
the Exchange Charge (if any) payable on the exchange of Shares. 
 
Where there is an exchange of Shares, Shares of the New Class will be allotted and issued in 
 respect of and in proportion to the Shares of the Original Class in the proportion S to R. 
An Exchange Charge of up to 2% of the Repurchase Price of the Shares being exchanged may be 
charged by the Company on the exchange of Shares. 

 <Page81>  
 
81 
 
 
 Limitations on Exchange 
Shares may not be exchanged for Shares of a different Class during any period when the 
calculation of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Fund or Funds is suspended in the manner 
described under “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value” below. Applicants for exchange of 
Shares will be notified of such postponement and, unless withdrawn, their applications will be 
considered as at the next Dealing Day following the ending of such suspension. Applicants 
exchanging Shares via the Distributor, a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System 
as the case may be have to contact directly the Distributor, the Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent 
or a Clearing System for arrangements regarding exchanges to be made or pending during such 
suspension period. Applications made or pending during such suspension period via the Distributor, 
a Sub-Distributor, a local paying agent or a Clearing System as the case may be, unless withdrawn, 
 will be considered as at the next Dealing Day following the end of such suspension. 
 Soft and hard closure 
The Board of Directors may, at any time and in its discretion, resolve to close a Fund or one or 
more Share Classes to exchange for a period of time. The circumstances in which it may do so 
include, but are not limited to, circumstances where the strategy run by the Investment Manager, 
of which the Fund forms part, has reached a size where, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, 
the universe of securities in which the strategy may invest may become too small to enable the 
Investment Manager to continue to invest the assets of the strategy effectively if the Fund, and 
therefore the strategy, continues to grow. Such Funds may be re-opened at any time by a resolution 
 of the Board of Directors. 
In exercising the discretion provided above, the Board of Directors may, at any time, decide to close 
a Fund or a Share Class and not to accept any further investment into the relevant Fund or Share 
Class either from (i) investors who have not yet invested into the said Funds or into the said Share 
Classes (“Soft Closure”) or (ii) any investor including investors already invested in the relevant 
 Fund or Share Class (“Hard Closure”). 
Decisions taken by the Board of Directors on Soft Closure and Hard Closure may have immediate 
 or non-immediate effect and may be effective for an unspecified period of time. 
In relation thereto, information on the closure and re-opening of these Share Classes or Funds will 
 be available at the registered office of the Company. 
Prohibition of Late Trading and Market Timing 
 
Late Trading is to be understood as the acceptance of a subscription (or conversion or redemption) 
order after the relevant Dealing Deadline (as specified below) on the relevant Dealing Day and the 
execution of such order at the price based on the Net Asset Value applicable to such same day. 
 Late Trading is strictly forbidden. 
Market Timing is to be understood as an arbitrage method through which an investor systematically 
subscribes and redeems or converts Shares of the Company within a short time period, by taking 
advantage of time differences and/or imperfections or deficiencies in the method of determination 
of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Fund. Market Timing practices may disrupt the investment 
 management of the portfolios and harm the performance of the relevant Fund. 
In order to avoid such practices, Shares are issued, converted and repurchased at an unknown 
price (except for Shares issued on the Launch Date) and neither the Company nor the Distributor 
 will accept orders received after the relevant cut-off times. 
The Company reserves the right to refuse purchase (and conversion) orders into a Fund by any 

 <Page82>  
 
82 
 
 person who is suspected of market timing activities. 
Calculation of Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets 
 
The Net Asset Value of a Fund shall be expressed in the currency in which the Shares are 
designated or in such other currency as the Board of Directors may determine either generally or 
in relation to a particular Class or in a specific case, and shall be calculated by ascertaining the 
value of the assets of the Fund and deducting from such value the liabilities of the Fund (excluding 
 Shareholders equity) as at the Valuation Point for such Dealing Day. 
The Net Asset Value per Share of a Fund will be calculated by dividing the Net Asset Value of the 
Fund by the number of Shares in the Fund then in issue or deemed to be in issue as at the Valuation 
Point for such Dealing Day and rounded down to two decimal places or such other number of 
 decimal places as may be determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. 
In the event the Shares of any Fund are further divided into Classes, the Net Asset Value per Class 
shall be determined by notionally allocating the Net Asset Value of the Fund amongst the Classes 
making such adjustments for subscriptions, repurchases, fees, dividends accumulation or 
distribution of income and the expenses, liabilities or assets attributable to each such Class 
(including the gains/losses on and costs of financial instruments employed for currency hedging 
between the currencies in which the assets of the Fund are designated and the designated currency 
of the Class, which gains/losses and costs shall accrue solely to that Class) and any other factor 
differentiating the Classes as appropriate. The Net Asset Value of the Fund, as allocated between 
each Class, shall be divided by the number of Shares of the relevant Class which are in issue or 
deemed to be in issue and rounded down to two decimal places as determined by the Directors or 
 such other number of decimal places as may be determined by the Directors from time to time. 
The Articles provide for the method of valuation of the assets and liabilities of each Fund and of the 
 Net Asset Value of each Fund. 
 The assets and liabilities of a Fund will be valued as follows: 
(a) 
Assets listed or traded on a stock exchange or on an over-the-counter market (other than 
those referred to at (e) and (g) below) for which market quotations are readily available 
shall be valued at the last quoted official close of business price on the principal exchange 
or market for such investment as at the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day 
provided that the value of any investment listed on a stock exchange but acquired or traded 
at a premium or at a discount outside the relevant stock exchange may be valued taking 
into account the level of premium or discount as at the date of valuation of the investment. 
Such premiums or discounts thereon above shall be provided by an independent broker or 
market maker or if such premiums/discounts are unavailable, by the Investment Manager. 
However, the Directors in agreement with the Investment Manager may adjust the value of 
investments traded on an over-the-counter market if it considers such adjustment is 
required to reflect the fair value thereof in the context of currency, marketability, dealing 
costs and/or such other considerations as are deemed relevant. 
 
If for specific assets the official close of business prices do not, in the opinion of the 
Directors, reflect their fair value or are not available, the value shall be calculated with care 
and in good faith by the Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager with a view 
to establishing the probable realisation value for such assets as at the Valuation Point for 
the relevant Dealing Day.  
 
(b) 
If the assets are listed or traded on several stock exchanges or over-the-counter markets, 
the official close of business prices on the stock exchange or over-the-counter market 
which, in the opinion of the Directors, constitutes the main market for such assets, will be 
used. 

 <Page83>  
 
83 
 
 
(c) 
In the event that any of the investments as at the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing 
Day are not listed or traded on any stock exchange or over-the-counter market, such 
securities shall be valued at their probable realisation value determined by the Directors 
with care and in good faith in consultation with the Investment Manager. Such probable 
realisation value will be determined: 
 
(i) 
by using the original purchase price; 
 
(ii) 
where there have been subsequent trades with substantial volumes, by using the 
last traded price provided the Directors in consultation with the Investment 
Manager consider such trades to be at arm's length; 
 
(iii) 
where the Directors believe the investment has suffered a diminution in value, by 
using the original purchase price which shall be discounted to reflect such a 
diminution; 
 
(iv) 
if the Directors in consultation with the Investment Manager believe a mid-
quotation from a broker is reliable, by using such a mid-quotation or, if unavailable, 
a bid quotation. 
 
Alternatively, the Directors in consultation with the Investment Manager, may use such 
probable realisation value estimated with care and in good faith and as may be 
recommended by a competent professional appointed by the Directors or the Investment 
Manager and approved for such purpose by the Depositary. Due to the nature of such 
unquoted securities and the difficulty in obtaining a valuation from other sources, such 
competent professional may be related to the Investment Manager. 
 
(d) 
Cash and other liquid assets will be valued at their face value with interest accrued, where 
applicable. 
 
(e) 
Units or shares in open-ended collective investment schemes will be valued at the latest 
available net asset value as at the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day; units or 
shares in closed-ended collective investment schemes will, if listed or traded on a stock 
exchange or regulated market, be valued at the official close of business price on the 
principal exchange or market for such investment as at the Valuation Point for the relevant 
Dealing Day or, if unavailable at the probable realisation value, as estimated with care and 
in good faith and as may be recommended by a competent professional appointed by the 
Directors or the Investment Manager and approved for the purpose by the Depositary. 
(f)  
Any value expressed otherwise than in the Base Currency of the relevant Fund (whether 
of an investment or cash) and any non-Base Currency borrowing shall be converted into 
the Base Currency at the rate (whether official or otherwise) which the Directors deem 
appropriate in the circumstances. 
 
(g) 
Exchange traded derivative instruments will be valued at the settlement price for such 
instruments on such market as at the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day; if such 
price is not available such value shall be the probable realisation value estimated with care 
and in good faith by the Directors. Over-the-counter derivative instruments will be valued 
at the latest valuation for such instruments as at the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing 
Day as provided by the relevant Approved Counterparty on a daily basis and verified on a 
weekly basis by a specialized unit or department of Barclays Bank PLC (being independent 
from such Approved Counterparty), approved for such purpose by the Depositary. Forward 
foreign exchange contracts shall be valued as at the Valuation Point for the relevant 
Dealing Day by reference to the prevailing market maker quotations, namely, the price at 
which a new forward contract of the same size and maturity could be undertaken, or, if 

 <Page84>  
 
84 
 
unavailable, they shall be valued at the settlement price as at the Valuation Point for the 
relevant Dealing Day as provided by the relevant Approved Counterparty on a daily basis 
and verified on a weekly basis by a specialized unit or department of Barclays Bank PLC 
(being independent from such Approved Counterparty), approved for such purpose by the 
Depositary. 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) to (g) above: 
• 
The Directors may, at their discretion in relation to any particular Fund which is a money 
market type Fund, value any investment with a known residual maturity of fifteen 
Months or less by using the amortised cost method of valuation whereby the 
investment is valued at its acquisition cost adjusted for amortisation of premium or 
accretion of discount on the investment. The Directors or their delegate shall review or 
cause a review to take place of deviations between the amortised method of valuation 
and the market value of investments, in accordance with the requirements of the 
Authority. 
 
• 
The Directors may value floating rate instruments by using the amortised cost method 
of valuation where such floating rate instruments: 
  
- 
have an annual or shorter reset date; and 
 
 
- 
are determined by the Directors to have a market value that 
approximates the amortised cost valuation; and 
 
 
- 
have a residual value of two years or less or, in the case of 
investment grade instruments, up to five years provided that 
procedures are adopted for instruments having a residual maturity 
of between two and five years to ensure that the valuation 
produced does not vary significantly from the true market value. 
 
• 
The Directors may, at their discretion, in relation to any particular Fund which is not a 
money market type fund but which invests in money market type instruments, value 
bonds, interest rate swaps, commercial paper, floating rate notes or similar instruments 
on the basis of amortised cost provided that each such security being valued using the 
amortised cost basis of valuation shall have a residual maturity not exceeding 6 Months. 
 
(h) 
In the event of it being impossible or incorrect to carry out a valuation of a specific 
investment in accordance with the valuation rules set out in paragraphs (a) to (g) above, or 
if such valuation is not representative of the security's fair market value, the value shall be 
estimated by the Directors or their delegate with care and in good faith, or by a competent 
person approved for the purpose by the Depositary, using an alternative method approved 
by the Depositary. 
 
If in any case a particular value is not ascertainable as provided above or if the Board of Directors 
shall consider that some other method of valuation better reflects the fair value of the relevant 
investment, then in such case the method of valuation of the relevant investment shall be such as 
the Directors in their absolute discretion shall determine, such method of valuation to be approved 
 by the Depositary. 
Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Values 
 
The Board of Directors may at any time temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value 
of any Fund and the subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares and the payment of 
 Repurchase Proceeds during: 
(i)  
any period when any of the markets on which a substantial portion of the investments of 

 <Page85>  
 
85 
 
the relevant Fund, from time to time, are quoted, listed or dealt in is closed, otherwise than 
for ordinary holidays, or during which dealings therein are restricted or suspended; or 
 
(ii) 
any period when, as a result of political, economic, military or monetary events or any 
circumstances outside the control, responsibility and power of the Directors, disposal or 
valuation of a substantial portion of the investments of the relevant Fund is not reasonably 
practicable without this being seriously detrimental to the interests of Shareholders of the 
relevant Fund or if, in the opinion of the Directors, the Net Asset Value of the Fund cannot 
be fairly calculated; or 
 
(iii) 
any breakdown in the means of communication normally employed in determining the price 
of a substantial portion of the investments of the relevant Fund, or when, for any other 
reason the current prices on any market of any of the investments of the relevant Fund 
cannot be promptly and accurately ascertained; or 
 
(iv)  
any period during which any transfer of funds involved in the realisation or acquisition of 
investments of the relevant Fund cannot, in the opinion of the Directors, be effected at 
normal prices or rates of exchange; or 
 
(v) 
any period when the Board of Directors is unable to repatriate funds required for the 
purpose of making payments due on the repurchase of Shares in the relevant Fund; or 
 
(vi) 
any period when the Board of Directors considers it to be in the best interest of the relevant 
Fund; or 
 
(vii) 
following the circulation to Shareholders of a notice of a general meeting at which a 
resolution proposing to wind up the Company or terminate the relevant Fund is to be 
considered; or 
 
(viii) 
following the suspension of (i) the calculation of the net asset value per share/unit, (ii) the 
issue, (iii) the redemption, and/or (iv) the conversion of the shares/units issued within the 
master fund in which a particular Fund invests in its quality as feeder fund. 
 
Where possible, all reasonable steps will be taken to bring any period of suspension to an end as 
 soon as possible. 
Shareholders who have requested subscriptions or repurchases of Shares of any Class or 
exchanges of Shares of one Class to another will be notified of any such suspension in such manner 
as may be directed by the Board of Directors and, unless withdrawn but subject to the limitation 
referred to above, their requests will be dealt with on the first relevant Dealing Day after the 
suspension is lifted. Any such suspension will be notified on the same Business Day to the Authority 
and, in relation to applicable Shares, as requested by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the 
competent authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Shares are marketed. Details of any such 
suspension will also be notified to all Shareholders and will be published in a newspaper circulating 
in an appropriate jurisdiction, or such other publications as the Board of Directors may determine 
 if, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, it is likely to exceed 14 days. 
Notification of Prices 
 
The issue price and Repurchase Price of each Class of Shares of each Fund will be available from 
the Administrator, will be notified without delay, if the relevant Shares are listed on the Luxembourg 
Stock Exchange, to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and may be published on each Business Day 
in one or more financial newspapers in such countries where the Funds are distributed to the public. 
Such prices will usually be the prices applicable to the previous Dealing Day’s trades and are 
 therefore only indicative. 

 <Page86>  
 
86 
 
Form of Shares, Share Certificates and Transfer of Shares 
 
Shares entered on the register of the Company will be in non-certificated form and share certificates 
will not be issued. Confirmation of ownership evidencing entry in the register will normally be issued 
 on a monthly basis upon receipt of all original documentation required by the Administrator. 
The transfer of interests in Shares registered in the name of a Clearing System may be arranged 
by the accountholder directly with the relevant Clearing System. Accountholders who wish to 
transfer their interests in Shares out of a Clearing System must also apply directly to the relevant 
Clearing System. Transfers made by the accountholders within any Clearing System may be made 
between accountholders on the books of the Clearing System and will not be registered on the 
register as the relevant Clearing System (or its nominee) will remain the registered Shareholder. 
The transfer of Shares by a Shareholder shall be effected by an instrument in writing in common 
form or in any other form approved by the Directors and signed by (or, in the case of a transfer by 
a body corporate, signed on behalf of or sealed by) the transferor. Transferees will be required to 
complete an Application Form and provide any other documentation reasonably required by the 
Administrator. In the case of the death of one of joint Shareholders, the survivor or survivors will be 
the only person or persons recognised by the Company as having any title to or interest in the 
 Shares registered in the names of such joint Shareholders. 
Shares may not be transferred to (i) a U.S. Person (unless permitted under certain exemptions 
under the laws of the United States); or (ii) any person who does not clear such money laundering 
checks as the Board of Directors may determine; or (iii) any person who appears to be in breach 
of any law or requirement of any country or governmental authority or by virtue of which such person 
is not qualified to hold such Shares; or (iv) any person or persons in circumstances (whether directly 
or indirectly affecting such person or persons, and whether taken alone or in conjunction with any 
other person or persons, connected or not, or any other circumstances appearing to the Board of 
Directors to be related) which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors might result in the Company 
incurring any liability to taxation or suffering any other pecuniary legal or material administrative 
disadvantages or being in breach of any law or regulation which the Company might not otherwise 
have incurred, suffered or breached; or (v) any individual under the age of 18 (or such other age 
as the Board of Directors may think fit) or of unsound mind; or (vi) any person unless the transferee 
of such Shares would, following such transfer, be the holder of Shares equal to or greater than the 
Minimum Initial Investment Amount; or (vii) any person in circumstances where as a result of such 
transfer the transferor or transferee would hold less than the Minimum Shareholding; or (viii) any 
person where in respect of such transfer any payment of taxation remains outstanding; or (ix) is 
any other circumstances prohibited by the Articles as described herein. Registration of any transfer 
may be refused by the Board of Directors if, following the transfer, either transferor or transferee 
would hold Shares having a value less than the Minimum Shareholding for that Class of Shares 
 specified in the Supplement for the relevant Fund.

____________________________________________________________________________ 
 
FEES AND EXPENSES 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
 Fees and Expenses Payable by the Company 
The Company will pay out of the assets of each Fund the fees and expenses payable to the 
Management Company, Investment Manager, Distributor, extraordinary expenses and the Fixed 
 Fee to the Management Company as described below. 
Management Fee 
In accordance with and subject to the terms of the Management Company Agreement, the annual 
Management Fee will be a percentage of the net assets of each Fund or Class of Shares or the 
Initial Issue Price, as indicated in the Supplement, subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1.250 
EUR per Fund. Management Fees are payable periodically at a rate which is within a range 
specified in the relevant Supplement of each Fund. The Management Fee will be calculated upon 
each Dealing Day. Fees payable to the Investment Manager, Investment Advisor, Distributor (other 
than the Preliminary Charge) or Sub-Distributor will be payable out of the Management Fee. The 
Management Company may instruct the Company to pay any such fees payable to the Investment 
Manager, Investment Advisor, Distributor or Sub-Distributor, directly out of the assets of the 
Company. In such case, the Management Fee due to the Management Company will be reduced 
accordingly.  
In respect of any Fund or Class of Shares the Management Company may choose to waive or 
rebate all or any portion of its fee and/or absorb some or all other expenses in its absolute 
 discretion for any period of time.  
Extraordinary Expenses 
The Company shall be liable for Extraordinary Expenses including, without limitation, expenses 
relating to litigation costs and any tax, levy, duty or similar charge imposed on the Company or its 
assets that would otherwise not qualify as ordinary expenses. Extraordinary Expenses are 
accounted for on a cash basis and are paid when incurred or invoiced on the basis of the Net Asset 
Value of each Fund to which they are attributable. Extraordinary Expenses are allocated across 
 each Class of Shares. 
Fixed Fees 
Fixed Fees means the fees payable by the Company for each Fund in respect of the ordinary fees, 
expenses and costs incurred by that Fund that include Transaction Fees and Administrative 
Expenses (including the Administrator’s Fees, the Depositary’s Fees, the Setting-Up Costs and 
 other Administrative Expenses) as further described below: 
1 
Administrator’s Fees 
The Administrator’s Fees which are normally due under the Administration Agreement. 
According to the Administration Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Administrator a 
fee for its services as central administration agent, domiciliary agent, registrar and transfer 
agent. 
 
2 
Depositary’s Fees 
The Depositary’s Fees, which are normally due under the Depositary Agreement. 
According to the Depositary Agreement, the Company pays to the Depositary a fee for its 
services as depositary of the assets of each Fund of the Company (which will also include 
the fees and expenses of correspondents which will be at normal commercial rates). The 
fee will be calculated on the basis of a percentage of the net assets of each Fund under 
the custody of the Depositary. 
  

 <Page88>  
 
88 
 
3 
Directors Fees 
Directors may receive an annual fee that is consistent with market rates. Directors that are 
associated with the Investment Manager will waive their right to receive such fees. 
 
4 
Other Administrative Expenses 
Other Administrative Expenses include but are not limited to; organisation and registration 
costs; licence fees payable to licence holders of an index; expenses for legal and auditing 
services; stamp duties, all taxes and VAT, company secretarial fees, any costs incurred in 
respect of meetings of Shareholders; marketing and distribution costs, investment 
transaction charges; costs incurred in respect of the distribution of income to Shareholders; 
the fees and expenses of any paying agent or representative appointed in compliance with 
the requirements of another jurisdiction; any amount payable under indemnity provisions 
contained in the Articles or any agreement with any appointee of the Company; cost of any 
proposed listings and maintaining such listings; all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of 
the Board of Directors; foreign registration fees and fees relating to the maintenance of 
such registrations including translation costs and local legal costs and other expenses due 
to supervisory authorities in various jurisdictions and local representatives’ remunerations 
in foreign jurisdictions; insurance; interest; the costs of printing and distributing this 
Prospectus and any costs incurred as a result of periodic updates of this Prospectus or the 
relevant Supplement, reports, accounts and any explanatory memoranda, any necessary 
translation fees, any fees in respect of circulating details of the Net Asset Value and such 
other information which is required to be published in the different jurisdictions, or of a 
change in law or the introduction of any new law (including any costs incurred as a result 
of compliance with any applicable code, whether or not having the force of law) may also 
be paid out of the assets of the Company. For avoidance of doubt, the Other Administrative 
Expenses (and therefore Fixed Fees) do not include debit interest payable to the 
Depositary. 
 
5 
Setting-Up Costs 
Setting-Up Costs include the cost of establishing the Company and new Funds. Upon 
creation of a new Fund the costs and expenses incurred in connection with its formation 
shall be written off over a period not exceeding five years against the assets of all existing 
Funds and in such amounts in each year and in each Fund as determined by the Board of 
Directors on an equitable basis in which case the new created Fund shall bear a pro-rata 
share of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the Company 
and the initial issue of Shares, which have not already been written off at the time of 
creation of the new Fund. 
 
6 
Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees are any fees and expenses incurred in buying and selling securities or 
other investments held by a Fund, e.g., brokerage costs and commissions and 
correspondence fees for transferring securities or investments or other interests, unless 
 otherwise specified in the relevant Supplement. 
Transaction Fees Payable by Shareholders 
 
 The Shares will be subject to different fee structures as detailed in the Supplements. 
Shareholders located outside Luxembourg may be subject to additional fees besides the 
Preliminary Charge, Repurchase Charge and Exchange Charge specified in the relevant 
     Supplement. Any such additional fees shall be set out in the relevant subscription documentation. 

 <Page89>  
 
89 
 
 Fixed Fee Arrangement 
The Company may in respect of each Fund (as specified in the relevant Supplement) enter into an 
arrangement with the Management Company, where the Management Company will in exchange 
for a Fixed Fee Payment (as defined in the relevant Supplement), finances the payment of the 
Fixed Fees described above. Where applicable, the Fixed Fee Payment is calculated on the 
average daily Net Asset Value per Fund or per Class of Shares or the Initial Issue Price (as will be 
 indicated in the Supplement) and is payable periodically. 
As the Fixed Fee is determined in advance on an annual basis by the Company and the 
Management Company, investors should note that the amount paid to the Management Company 
may at the end of the year be greater than if the Company would have directly paid these expenses. 
Conversely, the expenses the Company would have had to pay might be greater than the Fixed 
Fee and the effective amount paid by the Company to the Management Company would be less. 
The Fixed Fee will be determined and is intended to represent the expected costs to be incurred, 
on an arm’s length basis by the Company and the Management Company and will be disclosed in 
 the relevant Supplement. 
The Fixed Fee covers payments provided these do not exceed an annual threshold (as described 
in the relevant Supplement) and the Company may be liable to pay for any amount that exceeds 
this threshold. The Company will pay this amount out of the relevant Fund’s assets to which the 
specific costs are attributed.

____________________________________________________________________________ 
 
TAXATION  
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
 Warning 
The information set forth below is based on present law and administrative practice and may be 
subject to modification. Prospective investors should inform themselves of, and where appropriate 
take advice on, the laws and regulations (such as those relating to taxation and exchange controls) 
applicable to the subscription, purchase, holding, selling (via an exchange or otherwise) and 
redemption of Shares in the country of their citizenship, residence or domicile. 
Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings applies for 
Luxembourg tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, 
levy, impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or 
concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses 
corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt 
commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi), personal 
income tax (impôt sur le revenu) as well as a temporary equalization tax (impôt d’équilibrage 
budgétaire). Shareholders may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as 
other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax and the solidarity 
surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes. 
Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax, the solidarity surcharge and the 
temporary equalization tax. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the 
course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may 
 apply as well. 
 The Company 
Subscription tax 
Under current law and practice, the Company is not liable to any Luxembourg income tax. 
The Company is, however, liable in Luxembourg to a tax of 0.05 per cent per annum in respect of 
Classes of Shares and of 0.01 per cent per annum in respect of Classes of Shares for Institutional 
Investors (“Taxe d'Abonnement”). Investments by a Fund in shares or units of an undertaking for 
collective investment which has already been subject to the subscription tax are excluded from the 
Net Asset Value of the Fund serving as basis for the calculation of the Taxe d'Abonnement payable 
by that Fund. The Taxe d'Abonnement is payable quarterly on the basis of the Net Asset Value of 
the Fund at the end of the relevant calendar quarter. The benefit of the 0.01 per cent Taxe 
d'Abonnement is available to Classes of Shares for Institutional Investors on the basis of the 
Luxembourg legal, regulatory and tax provisions as these are known to the Company at the time 
of admission of an investor in such Classes of Shares. Such assessment is subject to such changes 
in the laws and regulations of Luxembourg and to such interpretation on the status of an eligible 
investor in the Classes of Shares for Institutional Investors by any competent Luxembourg authority 
as will exist from time to time. Any such reclassification made by an authority as to the status of an 
investor may submit the entire class to a Taxe d'Abonnement at the rate of 0.05 per cent p.a. 
Under current law and practice in Luxembourg, no capital gains tax is payable on the realised 
capital appreciation of the assets of the Company and no tax is payable on the investment income 
received in respect of the assets. Investment income for dividends and interest received by the 
Company may however be subject to withholding taxes in the country of origin at varying rates; 
    such withholding taxes are not recoverable. 

 <Page91>  
 
91 
 
Withholding tax 
Under current Luxembourg tax law, there is no withholding tax on any distribution, redemption or 
payment made by the SICAV to its Shareholders under the Shares. There is also no withholding 
 tax on the distribution of liquidation proceeds to the Shareholders. 
Other taxes 
No stamp or other tax will be payable in Luxembourg in connection with the issue of Shares by the 
Company, except a once and for all tax of euro 1,250 which was paid upon incorporation of the 
Company. Any amendment to the Articles is further generally subject to a fixed registration duty of 
 euro 75. 
VAT 
The Company is considered in Luxembourg as a taxable person for value added tax (“VAT”) 
purposes without input VAT deduction right. A VAT exemption applies in Luxembourg for services 
qualifying as fund management services. Other services supplied to the Company could potentially 
trigger VAT and require the VAT registration of the Company in Luxembourg as to self-assess the 
VAT regarded as due in Luxembourg on taxable services (or goods to some extent) purchased 
from abroad. 
No VAT liability arises in principle in Luxembourg in respect of any payments by the Company to 
its Shareholders, as such payments are linked to their subscription to the Shares and do therefore 
 not constitute the consideration received for taxable services supplied. 
 The Shareholders 
Luxembourg tax residency 
A Shareholder will not become resident, nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason 
only of the holding and/or disposing of the Shares or the execution, performance or enforcement 
 of his/her rights thereunder. 
Luxembourg resident Shareholders 
Luxembourg resident Shareholders are not liable to any Luxembourg income tax on reimbursement 
 of the share capital contributed to the Company. 
Luxembourg resident individuals 
Dividends and other payments derived from the Shares by a resident individual Shareholder, who 
acts in the course of the management of either his/her private wealth or his/ her 
 professional/business activity, are subject to income tax at the ordinary progressive rates. 
Capital gains realized upon the disposal of the Shares by a resident individual Shareholder, who 
acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, are not subject to income tax, 
unless said capital gains qualify either as speculative gains or as gains on a substantial participation. 
Capital gains are deemed to be speculative and are thus subject to income tax at ordinary rates if 
the shares are disposed of within 6 months after their acquisition or if their disposal precedes their 
acquisition. A participation is deemed to be substantial where a resident individual Shareholder 
holds or has held, either alone or together with his spouse or partner and/or minor children, directly 
or indirectly at any time within the 5 years preceding the disposal, more than 10% of the share 
capital of the company whose shares are being disposed of. A Shareholder is also deemed to 
alienate a substantial participation if he acquired free of charge, within the 5 years preceding the 
transfer, a participation that was constituting a substantial participation in the hands of the alienator 
(or the alienators in case of successive transfers free of charge within the same five-year period). 
Capital gains realized on a substantial participation more than 6 months after the acquisition thereof 
are taxed according to the half-global rate method (i.e. the average rate applicable to the total 
income is calculated according to progressive income tax rates and half of the average rate is 
applied to the capital gains realized on the substantial participation). A disposal may include a sale, 

 <Page92>  
 
92 
 
 an exchange, a contribution or any other kind of alienation of the participation. 
Capital gains realized on the disposal of the Shares by a resident individual Shareholder, who acts 
in the course of the management of his/her professional/business activity, are subject to income 
tax at ordinary rates. Taxable gains are determined as being the difference between the price for 
 which the Shares have been disposed of and the lower of their cost or book value. 
Luxembourg resident companies 
A Luxembourg resident company (société de capitaux) must include any profits derived, as well as 
any gain realized on the sale, disposal or redemption of Shares, in their taxable profits for 
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are determined as being the 
difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price and the lower of the cost or book value 
 of the Shares sold or redeemed. 
Luxembourg residents benefiting from a special tax regime 
Shareholders who are Luxembourg resident companies benefiting from a special tax regime, such 
as (i) undertakings for collective investment governed by the Law, (ii) specialized investment funds 
governed by the amended law of 13 February 2007 and (iii) family wealth management companies 
governed by the amended law of 11 May 2007, are income tax exempt entities in Luxembourg, and 
 profits derived from the Shares are thus not subject to Luxembourg income tax. 
Luxembourg non-resident Shareholders 
Shareholders, who are non-residents of Luxembourg and which have neither a permanent 
establishment nor a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which the Shares are attributable 
are generally not subject to any income, withholding, estate, inheritance, capital gains or other 
 taxes in Luxembourg. 
Corporate Shareholders which are non-residents of Luxembourg but which have a permanent 
establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Shares are 
attributable must include any income received, as well as any gain realised on the sale, disposal or 
redemption of Shares in their taxable income for Luxembourg tax assessment purposes. The same 
inclusion applies to individuals, acting in the course of the management of a professional or 
business undertaking, who have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in 
Luxembourg to which or whom the Shares are attributable. Taxable gains are determined as being 
the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price and the lower of the cost or book 
 value of the Shares sold or redeemed. 
Net worth tax 
A Luxembourg resident Shareholder, or a non-resident Shareholder which has a permanent 
establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Shares are 
attributable, is as a rule subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax on the Shares, except if the 
Shareholder is (i) a resident or non-resident individual taxpayer, (ii) an undertaking for collective 
investment subject to the Law, (iii) a securitization company governed by the law of 22 March 2004 
on securitization, (iv) a company governed by the law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles, 
(v) a specialized investment fund governed by the law of 13 February 2007, or (vi) a family wealth 
 management company governed by the law of 11 May 2007. 
However, subject to the law of 18 December 2015, a minimum net worth tax would be applicable 
for a securitization company governed by the amended law of 22 March 2004 on securitization and 
 a company governed by the amended law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles. 
Other taxes 
Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual Shareholder is a resident of Luxembourg for tax 
purposes at the time of his/her death, the Shares are included in his or her taxable basis for 
inheritance tax purposes. On the contrary, no inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of the Shares 
upon death of a Shareholder in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg for 

 <Page93>  
 
93 
 
 inheritance purposes. 
Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of the Shares, if the gift is recorded in a Luxembourg 
 notary deed or otherwise registered in Luxembourg. 
 FATCA 
Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the FATCA Law (as 
 defined below), unless provided otherwise herein. 
The Company may be subject to the so-called FATCA legislation which generally requires reporting 
to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with 
FATCA and direct or indirect ownership by U.S. persons (within the meaning of FATCA) of non-
U.S. entities. As part of the process of implementing FATCA, the U.S. government has negotiated 
intergovernmental agreements with certain foreign jurisdictions which are intended to streamline 
reporting and compliance requirements for entities established in such foreign jurisdictions and 
 subject to FATCA.  
Luxembourg has entered into a Model I Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) implemented by the 
amended Luxembourg law of 24 July 2015 (the “FATCA Law”), which requires Financial Institutions 
located in Luxembourg to report, when required, information on Financial Accounts held by 
 Specified U.S. Persons, if any, to the Luxembourg tax authorities.  
Under the terms of the FATCA Law, the Company is likely to be treated as a Luxembourg Reporting 
 Financial Institution.  
This status imposes on the Company the obligation to regularly obtain and verify information on all 
of its Shareholders. On the request of the Company, each Shareholder shall agree to provide 
certain information, including, in the case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”), 
information on the Controlling Persons of such NFFE, along with the required supporting 
documentation. Similarly, each Shareholder shall agree to actively provide to the Company within 
thirty (30) days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address 
 or a new residency address. 
FATCA may require the Company to disclose the names, addresses and taxpayer identification 
number (if available) of its Shareholders as well as information such as account balances, income 
and gross proceeds (non-exhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities (administration des 
contributions directes) for the purposes set out in the FATCA Law. Such information will be relayed 
 by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. 
Although the Company will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid imposition of 
FATCA withholding tax, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to satisfy these 
obligations. If the Company becomes subject to a withholding tax or penalties as result of the 
FATCA regime, the value of the Shares held by the Shareholders may suffer material losses. The 
failure for the Company to obtain such information from each Shareholder and to transmit it to the 
Luxembourg tax authorities may trigger the 30% withholding tax to be imposed on payments of U.S. 
source income and on proceeds from the sale of property or other assets that could give rise to 
 U.S. source interest and dividends as well as penalties.  
Any Shareholder that fails to comply with the Company’s documentation requests may be charged 
with any taxes and/or penalties imposed on the Company as a result of such Shareholder’s failure 
to provide the information and the Company may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Shares of such 
 Shareholder.  
Shareholders who invest through intermediaries are reminded to check if and how their 
intermediaries will comply with this U.S. withholding tax and reporting regime.

Shareholders should consult a U.S. tax advisor or otherwise seek professional advice regarding 
 the above requirements. 
 Exchange of information 
Under the Luxembourg laws dated 21 June 2005 implementing Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 
June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (“EUSD”), as amended 
by the Luxembourg law of 25 November 2014 concerning the procedure applicable to the exchange 
of tax information upon request, (together referred to as the “Laws”), and several agreements 
concluded between Luxembourg and certain dependant territories of the European Union, a 
Luxembourg paying agent (within the meaning of article 4.1 of EUSD) is required to provide the 
Luxembourg tax authority with information on payments of interest and other similar income paid 
by it to (or under certain circumstances, to the benefit of an individual or an entity (i) without legal 
personality (except for a Finnish avoin yhtiö and kommandiittiyhtiö/öppet bolag and 
kommanditbolag and a Swedish handelsbolag and kommanditbolag) and (ii) whose profits are not 
taxed under the general arrangements for the business taxation and (iii) that is not, or has not opted 
to be considered as, a UCITS recognized in accordance with EC Directive 85/611/EEC (“Residual 
Entity”) (within the meaning of article 4.2 of the EUSD), resident or established in another EU 
Member State as Luxembourg. The Luxembourg tax authority then communicates such information 
 to the competent authority of such EU Member State. 
The same regime applies to payments to individuals or Residual Entities resident or established in 
 any of the dependent or associated territories of the Member State.  
The EUSD has been repealed by Council Directive of 2015/2060 of 10 November 2015 with effect 
from 1 January 2016. However, for a transitional period, the EUSD shall continue to apply and 
notably regarding reporting obligations and scope of information to be provided by the Luxembourg 
paying agent (within the meaning of the EUSD) and regarding obligations of the Member States in 
respect of the issuance of the tax residence certificate and elimination of double taxation. As a 
consequence of the repeal of the EUSD, the Laws will no longer apply, save for the provisions 
related to the above mentioned obligations and within the transitional period foreseen by the said 
 Council Directive. 
On 9 December 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2014/107/EU 
amending Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of 
taxation which now provides for an automatic exchange of financial account information between 
EU Member States (“DAC Directive”), including income categories contained in the EUSD. The 
adoption of the aforementioned directive implements the CRS and generalises the automatic 
 exchange of information within the European Union as of 1 January 2016.  
Thus, the measures of cooperation provided by the EUSD are to be replaced by the implementation 
of the DAC Directive which is also to prevail in cases of overlap of scope. As Austria has been 
allowed to start applying the DAC Directive up to one year later than other Member States, special 
 transitional arrangements taking account of this derogation apply to Austria.  
In addition, Luxembourg signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement 
(“Multilateral Agreement”) to automatically exchange information under the CRS. Under this 
Multilateral Agreement, Luxembourg will automatically exchange financial account information with 
 other participating jurisdictions as of 1 January 2016.  
The Luxembourg law of 18 December 2015 relating to the automatic exchange of information in 
tax matters that implements the DAC Directive and the Multilateral Agreement in Luxembourg has 
 been published in the official journal on 24 December 2015 and is effective as from 1 January 2016. 
Shareholders should get information about, and where appropriate take advice on, the impact of 

 <Page95>

the changes to the EUSD, the implementation of the DAC Directive and the Multilateral Agreement 
   in Luxembourg and in their country of residence on their investment.

GENERAL INFORMATION 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
 The Shares 
 Rights attached to the Shares 
The Shares do not carry any preferential or pre-emptive rights and each Share, irrespective of the 
Class of Shares or Fund to which it relates is entitled to one vote at all general meetings of 
Shareholders. The Shares are issued without par value and must be fully paid for. The Shares in 
relation to any Fund, within a given Class of Shares, are freely transferable (provided that the 
Shares are not transferred to a prohibited person). Upon issue, and subject to the Class they belong 
to, the Shares are entitled to participate equally in the profits and dividends of the Fund attributable 
to the relevant Class of Shares in which they have been issued as well as in the liquidation proceeds 
 of such Fund. 
If bearer shares are issued for any Class of Shares, global share certificates or individual bearer 
 share certificates will be issued. No fractions of Shares will be issued. 
 Listing of the Shares  
Application can be made to list the Shares of each Class of Shares of the Funds on (i) the 
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (including Bourse de Luxembourg and Euro MTF), and/or (ii) the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and/or (iii) the Stuttgart Stock Exchange and/or (iv) any other stock 
exchange as determined by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors decides to create 
additional Funds or Classes it may in its discretion apply for the Shares of such Funds to be listed 
on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. For so long as the Shares of any Fund are listed on the 
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Fund shall comply with the requirements of the Luxembourg 
Stock Exchange relating to those Shares. For the purposes of compliance with the national laws 
and regulations concerning the offering and/or listing of the Shares outside Luxembourg this 
document may have attached to it one or more documents setting out information relevant for the 
 jurisdictions in which the Shares are offered for subscription. 
 Dividend policy 
 The dividend policy for any Class of Shares will be indicated in the relevant supplement. 
In the event that a dividend is paid in one or several Funds, such dividend will be paid to the 
registered Shareholders by electronic wire. All dividends will be calculated and paid in accordance 
 with the requirements of the relevant stock exchange. 
For holders of Individual bearer share certificates, payment of the dividend in cash will be remitted 
 against tender of the appropriate coupons. 
 The Company 
 Incorporation of the Company 
The Company is an investment company that has been incorporated under the laws of the Grand-
Duchy of Luxembourg as a SICAV on 17 September 2007 for an unlimited period. The minimum 
 capital required by the Law is euro 1,250,000. 
The Articles have been deposited with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies’ Register (“Registre 
de Commerce et des Sociétés de Luxembourg”) and have been published in the Recueil des 

 <Page97>  
 
97 
 
Sociétés et Associations of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg (the “Mémorial”) on 22 October 2007. 
The Articles have been amended for the last time on 3 July 2015. The Company is registered with 
 the Luxembourg Trade and Companies’ Register under number B-132073. 
 Merger of Funds or Classes of Shares 
The Board of Directors of the Company may decide to proceed with a merger (within the meaning 
of the Law) of the assets of the Company, or any Fund with those of (i) another existing Fund within 
the Company or another compartment within such other Luxembourg or foreign UCITS (the “New 
Fund”), or of (ii) another Luxembourg or foreign UCITS (the “New UCITS”), and to designate the 
Shares of the Company or of the Fund as Shares of the New UCITS or of the New Fund, as 
applicable. The Board of Directors of the Company is competent to decide on or approve the 
effective date of the merger. Such a merger shall be subject to the conditions and procedures 
imposed by the Law, in particular concerning the terms of the merger to be established by the Board 
 of Directors of the Company and the information to be provided to the Shareholders. 
Notwithstanding the powers conferred to the Board of Directors by the preceding section, a merger 
(within the meaning of the Law) of the assets and of the liabilities attributable to any Fund with 
another Fund within the Company may be decided upon by a general meeting of the Shareholders 
of the involved Fund, at which there shall be no quorum requirement and which shall decide upon 
the merger by resolutions taken by simple majority of the votes validly cast. The general meeting 
of the Shareholders of the involved Funds will decide on the effective date of such a merger it has 
initiated within the Company by resolution taken with no quorum requirement and adopted at a 
 simple majority of the votes validly cast. 
The Shareholders may also decide a merger (within the meaning of the Law) of the assets and of 
the liabilities attributable to the Company or any Fund with the assets of any New UCITS or New 
Fund within another UCITS. Such a merger and the decision on the effective date of such a merger 
shall require resolutions of the Shareholders of the Company or Fund concerned subject to the 
quorum and majority requirements provided for the amendment of the Articles. The assets which 
may not or are unable to be distributed to such Shareholders for whatever reasons will be deposited 
 with the Caisse de Consignation on behalf of the persons entitled thereto.  
Where the Company or any of its Funds is the absorbed entity which, thus, ceases to exist and 
irrespective of whether the merger is initiated by the Board of Directors or by the Shareholders, the 
general meeting of Shareholders of the Company or of the relevant Fund must decide the effective 
date of the merger. Such general meeting will decide by resolution taken with no quorum 
 requirement and adopted at a simple majority of the votes validly cast. 
The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the power to resolve to merge one or several 
Classes from one or more Funds with one or more Classes within the same or other Fund of the 
 Company. 
In case of merger of the Company with another UCITS, Shareholders are entitled to request, 
without any charge other than those retained by the Company or the Fund to meet divestment costs, 
 the repurchase or redemption of their Shares, in accordance with the Law. 
Any cost associated with the preparation and the completion of the merger shall neither be charged 
 to the Company nor to the Shareholders. 
In the event that the Board of Directors of the Company believes it is required for the interests of 
the Shareholders of the relevant Fund or that a change in the economic or political situation relating 
to the Fund concerned has occurred which would justify it, the reorganisation of one Fund, by 
means of a division into two or more Funds, may be decided by the Board of Directors of the 
Company. Such decision will be published in the same manner as described above and, in addition, 
the publication will contain information in relation to the two or more new Funds. Such publication 

 <Page98>  
 
98 
 
will be made one month before the date on which the reorganisation becomes effective in order to 
enable the Shareholders to request redemption of their Shares, free of charge before the operation 
 involving division into two or more Funds becomes effective. 
In the event that for any reason the value of the assets in any Class has decreased to an amount 
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in the interests of Shareholders to be the 
minimum level for such Class to be operated in an economically efficient manner, or if a change in 
the economical, political or monetary situation relating to the Class concerned would have material 
adverse consequences on the investments of that Class or if the range of products offered to 
investors is rationalised, the Board of Directors of the Company may decide to allocate the assets 
of any Class to those of another existing Class within the Company and to redesignate the Shares 
of the Class or Classes concerned as Shares of another Class (following a split or consolidation, if 
necessary, and the payment of the amount corresponding to any fractional entitlement to 
 Shareholders). 
The Company shall send a written notice to the Shareholders of the relevant Class one month prior 
to the effective date for the amalgamation in order to enable Shareholders to request redemption 
or conversion of their Shares, free of charge, during such period. This notice will indicate the 
reasons and the procedure for the amalgamation operations. Unless it is otherwise therein advised 
in the interests of Shareholders, or to maintain equality of treatment between the Shareholders, the 
Shareholders of the Class concerned may continue to request redemptions or conversions of their 
Shares without any additional charges (but taking into account actual realisation prices of 
 investments and realisation expenses) prior to the effective date of the compulsory redemption. 
A contribution of the assets and of the liabilities attributable to any Class to another Class within 
any Fund of the Company may be decided upon by a general meeting of the Shareholders of the 
Class concerned for which there shall be no quorum requirements and which will decide upon such 
 an amalgamation by resolution taken by simple majority of the validly cast votes. 
 Dissolution and Liquidation of the Company 
The Company has been established for an unlimited period of time. However, the Company may 
be dissolved and liquidated at any time by a resolution of an extraordinary general meeting of 
Shareholders. Such a meeting must be convened if the Net Asset Value of the Company becomes 
 less than two thirds of the minimum required by the Law. 
In the event of dissolution, the liquidator(s) appointed by the Shareholders of the Company will 
realise the assets of the Company in the best interests of the Shareholders, and the Administrator, 
upon instruction given by the liquidator(s), will distribute the net proceeds of liquidation (after 
deducting all liquidation expenses) among the Shareholders of each Class of Shares in proportion 
to their respective rights. As provided for by Luxembourg law, at the close of liquidation, the 
proceeds of liquidation corresponding to Shares not surrendered for repayment will be kept in safe 
custody at the “Caisse de Consignation”. If not claimed, they shall be forfeited after 30 years. If an 
 event requiring liquidation arises issue, redemption, exchange or conversion of the Shares are void. 
 Termination of Funds 
In the event that the Net Asset Value of any Fund or Class of Shares on a given Valuation Day 
shall become at any time less than the Minimum Net Asset Value, the Company may in its discretion 
redeem all of the Shares relating to the relevant Fund or the Class of Shares then outstanding, or 
if a change in the economic or political situation relating to such Fund or Class of Shares would 
have material adverse consequences on the investments of that Fund or Class of Shares, the Board 
of Directors may decide to compulsorily redeem all the Shares relating to the relevant Fund or Class 
of Shares at the Net Asset Value per Share (taking into account actual realisation prices of 
investments and realisation expenses), calculated on the Valuation Day specified as the effective 
date for such redemption. The Company shall serve a notice to the Shareholders of the relevant 

 <Page99>  
 
99 
 
Class of Shares or Fund in writing and/or by way of publication in newspapers in accordance with 
the Articles prior to the effective date for the compulsory redemption, which will indicate the reasons 
 for, and the procedure of, the redemption operations. 
In addition, the general meeting of Shareholders of a Fund or of a Class of Shares issued in any 
Fund may, upon proposal from the Board of Directors, resolve to close a Fund or a Class of Shares 
by way of liquidation or to redeem all the Shares relating to the relevant Fund or Class of Shares 
issued in a Fund and refund to the Shareholders the Net Asset Value of their Shares (taking into 
account actual realisation prices of investments and realisation expenses) calculated on the 
Valuation Day at which such decision shall take effect. There shall be no quorum requirements for 
such general meeting of Shareholders which shall decide by resolution taken by simple majority of 
those present or represented. For Funds for which no Maturity Date has been designated, the 
Board of Directors may in accordance with the provisions of the Articles in its discretion decide to 
close such a Fund and redeem all the Shares relating to such Fund and refund to the Shareholders 
the Net Asset Value of their Shares (taking into account actual realisation prices of investments 
and realisation expenses) calculated on the Valuation Day at which such decision shall take effect. 
The Shareholders of the relevant Fund will be notified of the decision of the Board of Directors or 
the resolution of the general meeting of Shareholders in that Fund to redeem all the Shares by the 
publication of a notice in the Mémorial as well as, if necessary and required by the laws of the 
respective country, in the official publications specified for the respective countries in which the 
 shares are sold. 
All redeemed Shares shall be cancelled and will become null and void. Upon compulsory 
 redemptions, the relevant Fund or Class of Shares will be closed. 
Liquidation or Redemption Proceeds which may not be distributed to the relevant Shareholders 
upon termination will be kept in safe custody at the “Caisse de Consignation” on behalf of the 
 persons entitled thereto. If not claimed, they shall be forfeited after 30 years. 
 General Meetings 
The annual general meeting of Shareholders of the Company is held at the registered office of the 
Company and will be held on the last Tuesday of March of each year (or if such day is not a 
 Luxembourg Banking Day, on the previous Luxembourg Banking Day). 
Shareholders of any Class of Shares or Fund may hold, at any time, general meetings to decide 
on any matters which relate exclusively to such Fund or to such Class of Shares. 
 
Notices of all general meetings will be sent by mail to all registered Shareholders at their registered 
address at least 8 calendar days prior to the meeting. Such notice will indicate the time and place 
of the meeting, the conditions of admission thereto, will contain the agenda and refer to the 
requirements of Luxembourg law with regard to the necessary quorum and majorities at the meeting. 
To the extent required by law, further notices will be published in the Mémorial, in a Luxembourg 
 newspaper and/or such other newspapers as the Board of Directors may determine.

Audited Annual Reports, containing the audited consolidated financial reports of the Company and 
the Funds expressed in euro in respect of the preceding financial period, will be sent to the 
registered Shareholders and made available at the registered office of the Company, of the

 Sustainable Finance Disclosure 
In 2018, the EU Commission put forward an action plan on financing sustainable growth as part of 
its wider initiative on environmental, social and governance matters. Action 7 of the action plan 
called for measures aimed at clarifying institutional investors’ and asset managers’ duties regarding 
sustainability. A proposal was presented to enhance the disclosures relating to sustainable 
investments and sustainable risks, which culminated in the adoption of the EU’s Sustainable 
Finance Disclosure Regulation (the “SFDR”). The aim of SFDR is to provide information to investors 
 to make it easier for investors to make informed investment choices. 
The purpose of this section is to provide investors with certain of the disclosures which are required 
 under the SFDR. 
 Sustainability risks 
The Investment Manager recognises that the assets held by certain Funds face growing 
sustainability risks; these risks mean environmental, social or governance (“ESG”) events or 
conditions that, if they occur, could cause an actual or a potential material negative impact on the 
   value of an investment within a Fund and, in turn, the net asset value of the Fund. 

 <Page102>  
 
102 
 
 How sustainability risks are integrated into the investment decisions of the Investment Manager 
The Investment Manager approaches the integration of sustainability risks as part of a broad review 
of a Fund’s investments. The Investment Manager integrates sustainability risks, where they 
represent a potential or actual material risk to a Fund by identifying risks, measuring them using 
the likelihood of occurrence of each risk and the severity of impact to the value of the investments 
made for the Funds, and should the risk occur, managing these risks and monitoring them on an 
ongoing basis. The Funds, having a diversified portfolio, may be exposed to different sustainability 
 risks varying from issuers, markets, sector, financial instruments and geographical regions. 
Furthermore, where the investment objective of a Fund relies on the replication of an index or 
strategy, the investment decision-making process implemented by the Investment Manager will 
follow a rules-based approach. While the Fund portfolio will be exposed to sustainability risks 
overall by virtue of its construction, the decisions made by the Investment Manager will be driven 
by the need to efficiently replicate the index rather than by specific consideration of sustainability 
 risks with respect to each component of the index. 
Given the high level of diversification and risk spreading of the Funds, and unless specified in the 
relevant Supplement (section “Other information”, sub-section “Risk Factors”), it is not anticipated 
that any single sustainability risk will drive a material negative financial impact on the value of a 
 Fund. 
 Likely impact of sustainability risks on returns 
The ability to assess the likely impact of sustainability risks on the returns of the Funds is complex. 
The assessment of sustainability risks requires subjective judgements, and is based on data which 
is difficult to obtain and incomplete, estimated, out of date or otherwise materially inaccurate. Even 
when identified, there can be no guarantee that the impact of sustainability risks on the Fund’s 
 investments will be correctly assessed. 
To the extent that a sustainability risk occurs, or occurs in a manner that is not anticipated, there 
may be a sudden, material negative impact on the value of an investment, and hence the returns 
of a Fund. Such negative impact may result in an entire loss of value of the relevant investment(s) 
 and may have an equivalent negative impact on the returns of a Fund. 
The impacts following the occurrence of a sustainability risk may be numerous and vary depending 
on the specific risk and asset class. In general, where a sustainability risk occurs in respect of an 
asset, there will be a negative impact on, and may be an entire loss of, its value. For a company, 
this may be because of damage to its reputation with a consequential fall in demand for its products 
or services, loss of key personnel, exclusion from potential business opportunities, increased costs 
of doing business and/or increased cost of capital. A company may also suffer the impact of fines 
and other regulatory sanctions. The time and resources of the corporate’s management team may 
be diverted from furthering its business and be absorbed seeking to deal with the sustainability risk, 
including changes to business practices and dealing with investigations and litigation. Sustainability 
risks may also give rise to loss of assets and/or physical loss including damage to real estate and 
infrastructure. The utility and value of assets held by businesses to which a Fund is exposed may 
 also be adversely impacted by a sustainability risk. 
Where a sustainability risk occurs in respect of an individual component of an index, the impact on 
the index overall will be mitigated. However, where the sustainability risk impacts a sector or sub-
sector to which the index relates, then this may result in the Fund being materially adversely 
 impacted and the value of an investment in the Fund may be reduced. 
Sustainability risks are relevant as both standalone risks, and also as cross-cutting risks which 
manifest through many other risk types which are relevant to the assets of a Fund. For example, 
the occurrence of a sustainability risk can give rise to financial and business risk, including though 

 <Page103>  
 
103 
 
a negative impact on the credit worthiness of other businesses. The increasing importance given 
to sustainability considerations by both businesses and consumers means that the occurrence of 
a sustainability risk may result in significant reputational damage to affected businesses. The 
occurrence of a sustainability risk may also give rise to enforcement risk by governments and 
 regulators, and also litigation risk. 
A sustainability risk may arise and impact a specific investment or may have a broader impact on 
 an economic sector, geographical regions and/or jurisdictions and political regions. 
Many economic sectors, regions and/or jurisdictions, including those in which a Fund may invest, 
are currently and/or in the future may be, subject to a general transition to a greener, lower carbon 
and less polluting economic model. Drivers of this transition include governmental and/or regulatory 
intervention, evolving consumer preferences and/or the influence of non-governmental 
 organisations and special interest groups. 
Laws, regulations and industry norms play a significant role in controlling the impact on 
sustainability factors of many industries, particularly in respect of environmental and social factors. 
Any changes in such measures, such as increasingly stringent environmental or health and safety 
laws, can have a material impact on the operations, costs and profitability of businesses. Further, 
businesses which are in compliance with current measures may suffer claims, penalties and other 
liabilities in respect of alleged prior failings. Any of the foregoing may result in a material loss in 
 value of an investment linked to such businesses. 
Further, certain industries face considerable scrutiny from regulatory authorities, non-governmental 
organisations and special interest groups in respect of their impact on sustainability factors, such 
as compliance with minimum wage or living wage requirements and working conditions for 
personnel in the supply chain. The influence of such authorities, organizations and groups along 
with the public attention they may bring can cause affected industries to make material changes to 
their business practices which can increase costs and result in a material negative impact on the 
profitability of businesses. Such external influence can also materially impact the consumer 
demand for a business’s products and services which may result in a material loss in value of an 
 investment linked to such businesses. 
Sectors, regions, businesses and technologies which are carbon-intensive, higher polluting or 
otherwise cause a material adverse impact on sustainability factors may suffer from a significant 
fall in demand and/or obsolescence, resulting in stranded assets the value of which is significantly 
reduced or entirely lost ahead of their anticipated useful life. Attempts by sectors, regions, 
businesses and technologies to adapt so as to reduce their impact on sustainability factors may not 
be successful, may result in significant costs being incurred, and future ongoing profitability may 
 be materially reduced. 
In the event that a sustainability risk arises this may cause investors to determine that a particular 
investment is no longer suitable and to divest of it (or not make an investment in it), further 
 exacerbating the downward pressure on the value of the investment. 
 Principal adverse impacts (“PAIs”) 
The investment portfolios of the Funds are primarily delivered using quantitative methodologies or 
in pursuit of a return linked to an index and, unless explicitly noted as such, consideration of PAIs 
of investment decisions on sustainability factors is not undertaken as it is not a material 
consideration to the investment process and has not been included in the mechanism for 
  determination of the portfolio.

 portfolio and may not be appropriate for all investors. 
Certain risks attached to an investment in the Fund are set out in the Prospectus in the

Factors" of this Supplement for a discussion of certain risks that should be considered by

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The Investment Objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with a return linked to the 
performance of the Underlying, being the Portfolio, such that the redemption amount payable in 
respect of each Share on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date is at least equal to the Minimum 
Protection Level. The Portfolio comprises allocation to the Multi-Asset Basket and the Protection 
 Component, dynamically rebalanced in accordance with the Protection Strategy. 
The Protection Strategy is expected to ensure that the assets of the Fund are sufficient to provide 
investors with redemption proceeds equal to at least the Minimum Protection Level on or after the 
Scheduled Maturity Date. Therefore, if an investor redeems their Shares prior to the 
Scheduled Maturity Date, the Net Asset Value of the Shares which are repurchased may be 
less than the Minimum Protection Level and such investor may therefore receive less than 
 the Minimum Protection Level. 
To cover the possibility of a failure of the Protection Strategy to achieve its objective, the 
Company has ensured it has Fallback Protection for the holders of Class A and Class B 
Shares. It should be noted that the holders of Class C Shares do not benefit from any 
Fallback Protection and the Company has not entered into any such protection on behalf of 
the Class C Shares. In the event the Protection Strategy does fail, the Fund will not provide 
the holders of Class C Shares with principal protection and they may receive less than the 
Minimum Protection Level. Please note that an investment in any Class of Shares in the 
Fund is only principal protected in certain conditions for Class A and Class B Shares. Class 
C Shares are not principal protected in the event of a failure of the Protection Strategy to 
 achieve its objective The Fund is NOT guaranteed. 
The Portfolio and the Protection Strategy are further described in the section "General Description 
 of the Underlying" below. 
Prospective investors should read the section titled "Risk Factors" below and also the 
section of the Prospectus titled "Risk Factors" for a description of certain risks associated 
 with an investment in the Fund. 
 Investment Policy 
In order to achieve the investment objective, the Company on behalf of the Fund intends to invest 
the net proceeds of any issue of Shares (whether on the Launch Date or subsequently) in one or 
more fund assets consisting of FDIs (including Derivative Contracts in the form of options and/ or 
swap contracts), Transferable Securities, Money Market Instruments, other UCITS, assets and 
instruments used for the purpose of efficient portfolio management, Other Financial Instruments or 
such other securities, assets or investments as determined by the Investment Manager. The 
Underlying Investments together with ancillary cash held by the Fund shall constitute the "Fund 
 Assets" for the purposes of the Prospectus. 
The Fund may enter into certain Derivative Contracts in the form of Funded Swaps and/or unfunded 
swaps, (“Unfunded Swaps” and, together with the Funded Swaps, the “Swaps”), in each case 
with the Approved Counterparty (see section “Use of Derivative Contracts”) in order to gain 
 exposure to all or part of the Underlying in accordance with the advice of the Investment Manager. 
The Approved Counterparty and the Company on behalf of the Fund has entered into an ISDA 
Master Agreement (and related Credit Support Annex) and will enter into confirmations which will 
govern the Derivative Contracts including provisions relating to the termination of the Derivative 

 <Page113>  
 
113 
 
 Contracts. 
The Approved Counterparty to the Derivative Contracts will be required under the terms of the 
relevant contract to provide collateral to the Company so that the Company's risk exposure to the 
 relevant Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent required by the Law. 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day (each as defined under 
“Terms of the Shares Representing Interests in the Fund – General Information Relating to the 
Fund”) in order to determine the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out 
 in the Prospectus. 
The Fund itself will in no circumstances be leveraged for investment purposes and will therefore 
 not be subject to any shortfall risk. 
 The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. 
Further information relevant to the Fund’s investment policy is contained in the main part of the 
 Prospectus under “Investment Objectives and Policies” and under “Investment Restrictions”. 
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor seeking a capital protection strategy linked to a diversified 
portfolio of assets and who is prepared to accept a medium degree of volatility until the Scheduled 
 Maturity Date. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The subscription price and the Repurchase Price at which a Share will be subscribed for or 
repurchased, as the case may be, on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant 
Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with any applicable Preliminary 
Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge and in accordance with the provisions of this 
 section. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day: (a) as the value of the Fund 
Assets will increase or decrease over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; (b) 
as the fees and expenses in relation to the Fund will accrue over time; and (c) due to dealing 
charges, taxes and other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund 
 Assets. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class for subscription or repurchase may be respectively adjusted 
in accordance with the Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no dealing 
in the Fund or Share Class on the relevant Dealing Day, the subscription price or the Repurchase 
Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share Class rounded downwards to such number 
 of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
Accordingly, you should note that the Net Asset Value per Share Class in respect of a 
repurchase of Shares at any time may be less than the original value of your investment 
under certain circumstances, and you should be prepared to sustain a loss on your 
         investment.

The examples shown in the table assume that the Fund holds only Swaps and ancillary cash and 
is collateralised to the extent required by the Law, and is receiving the performance of the 
Underlying pursuant to the Swaps (see “Use of Derivative Contract” below). It also assumes a 
constant investment with no additional subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without 
 deduction of any fees or expenses. 
 Use of Derivative Contracts 
The Fund may be exposed to all or part of the Underlying through investing in Derivative Contracts 
with the Approved Counterparty. With respect to Funded Swaps, the Fund will pay some or all of 
the net subscription proceeds to the Approved Counterparty in exchange for the Approved 
Counterparty paying a return linked to all or relevant part of the Underlying. With respect to 
Unfunded Swaps or any other unfunded Derivative Contracts, no upfront payments are made to 
 the Approved Counterparty. 
The Approved Counterparty will be required under the terms of the relevant Derivative Contracts 
to provide collateral to the Company if the exposure of the Fund to the Approved Counterparty 
exceeds certain limits so that the Company's risk exposure to the relevant Approved Counterparty 
is reduced to the extent required by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in 
 the Prospectus. Such collateral costs may be charged to the Fund. 
The value of the Derivative Contracts may vary due to restrictions imposed on the hedging 
instruments and changes or modifications in the hedging instrument and may be terminated or 
 otherwise cancelled in each case in accordance with its terms. 
The Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with the Authority. 
The Fund will only invest in FDIs in accordance with its risk management policy agreed with 
the Authority. The Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative 
limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of 
 the main categories of investments. 
Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that, with the advice of the Investment Manager, 
     the Fund uses TRS in order to gain exposure to all or part of the Underlying. 

 <Page115>  
 
115 
 
The expected and maximum proportion of the total assets which may be subject to TRS is 
summarized in the table below. In certain circumstances this proportion may be higher.

Maximum level (in % 
of total assets)  
Funded TRS

Unfunded TRS

 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund may utilize different FDIs for efficient portfolio management purposes or to seek to hedge 
against declines in the Fund Assets as a result of changes in currency exchange rates or interest 
rates. All hedging transactions will be clearly attributable to a specific Share Class and therefore 
currency exposures of different Share Classes shall not be combined or offset and currency 
exposures of assets of the Fund Assets shall not be allocated to separate Share Classes. 
Furthermore, any Derivative Contracts entered into by the Investment Manager on behalf of the 
 Fund could expose the Fund to credit risk from the creditworthiness of the counterparty. 
While it is not the intention of the Fund, it is possible that over-hedged or under-hedged positions 
 may arise due to factors outside the control of the Investment Manager. 
It is expected that the extent to which such currency exposure will be hedged will range from 95% 
to 105% of the Net Asset Value attributable to the relevant Share Class. Where the value of the 
hedges in place in respect of a given Share Class are less or more than 100% of the Net Asset 
Value attributable to that Share Class, the Investment Manager shall keep the situation under 
review and will ensure that over hedged positions do not exceed 105% of the Net Asset Value. 
Positions materially in excess of 100% of the Net Asset Value will not be carried forward from month 
to month. While it is not the intention of the Fund, over-hedged or under-hedged positions may 
 arise due to factors outside the control of the Fund. 
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Disruption Events  
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good faith, 
make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets and/or Portfolio 
Components. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 
 
(ii) the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value” and/or 
 
(iii) the Directors may, in certain circumstances as set out in the Prospectus, terminate the 
Fund.

will not exceed 30% of the total Net Asset Value of the Fund; 
 
(vi) there will be no exposure, whether directly or indirectly to covered bonds and mortgages 
(‘Grundpfandtitel’). 
 
(C) 
Where the Fund Assets comprise investments in one or more Collective Investment 
Schemes, such Fund Assets will be further subject to the following restrictions: 
 
(i) such Collective Investment Schemes comply with section (A) herein above when making 
investments in Investment Instruments; 
 
(ii) it is intended that such Collective Investment Schemes have been organised in respect 
of the investment guidelines, authorities, allocation of the investors' share of investments, 
as well as sale and redemption of the shares in a manner such that the interests of the 
investors are protected in a transparent manner; and 
 
(iii) it is intended that in the event of the bankruptcy of the relevant Collective Investment 
Scheme or its depositary bank, the assets of such Collective Investment Scheme can 
be legally segregated, subject to applicable local laws. 
 
The direct investments made by Collective Investment Schemes which comprise Fund Assets are 
to be taken into account in determining compliance with the limits under (B) above, whereby the 
limits pursuant to (B)(i) and (ii) shall be deemed to be fulfilled if (a) the direct investments of the 
Collective Investment Schemes are appropriately diversified or (b) the individual ownership 
interests in a Collective Investment Scheme are less than five percent of the total assets of the 

 <Page117>

Fund. 
 
(D) 
Where the Fund Assets comprise FDI, such Fund Assets will be further subject to the 
following further restrictions: 
 
(i) restrictions under (A) herein above will be observed as regards the underlying of such 
FDI; and 
 
(ii) the use of FDI does not have a leverage effect on the total assets of the Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will solely be entitled to look to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each Derivative Contract may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against 
the Company in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to the Derivative Contracts are 
expressed to be limited to the Fund Assets, and the Approved Counterparty will have no recourse 
to any other assets of the Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the 
application of such realisation proceeds in payment of all claims of the Approved Counterparty 
relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the Company ranking pari passu with or senior 
to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount 
outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically extinguished, (b) the Approved 
Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof and (c) the Approved 
Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company as a consequence of 
 any such shortfall. 
The holders of Class C Shares will not benefit from any Fallback Protection provided by the Fund 
in the event the Protection Strategy fails. The Class C Shares will, however, participate in the same 
pool of assets as the Class A and B Shares (save for the Derivative Contract entered into which 
relates to the Fallback Protection) but will not benefit from such Derivative Contract in the event 
that the Protection Strategy fails, nor will the holders of Class C Shares have any recourse against 
 such Derivative Contract. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
 Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. 
 Leverage 
The Fund will not be leveraged for the purpose of investment. In accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations, the Fund's use of leverage will be calculated in line with the commitment 
approach and its global exposure through the use of FDIs will not exceed total value of the Fund’s 
 assets. The Fund will not borrow for investment purposes. 
 Dividend Policy 
     There are no dividend entitlements for the Shares.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING 
 
 
(A) 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
 
The Underlying, the Multi-Asset Protected Portfolio (the "Portfolio"), is a notional portfolio which 
 comprises a dynamic allocation to the following Portfolio Components: 
 1) the Multi-Asset Basket; and 
2) the Protection Component, 
 
 each as described further below. 
The Portfolio follows a dynamic allocation strategy (the "Protection Strategy") that algorithmically 
manages the allocation of the Portfolio to the Portfolio Components. The Protection Strategy is 
expected to ensure that value of the Portfolio, and that of the Fund Assets, is sufficient to generate 
a Net Asset Value per Share on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date, which is at least equal to the 
 Minimum Protection Level. 
(B) 
DESCRIPTION OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPONENTS 
 
(1) 
The Multi-Asset Basket 
 
The Multi-Asset Basket comprises a basket of notional exposures to a set of diversified long only 
and long/short asset allocation portfolios (the “Basket Components”, and each individually, a 
“Basket Component”) as described below. The aggregate weight of all assets and instruments 
included in all the Basket Components will not exceed 100% of the allocation of the Portfolio to the 
 Multi-Asset Basket. 
From time to time the Investment Manager may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the 
allocation to any single Basket Component included within the Multi-Asset Basket, subject to the 
following investment limits (the “Basket Component Investment Limits”):

 Description of the Basket Components 
Absolute Return 
This portfolio allocates to a broadly diversified set of assets on the basis of a systematic long/short 

 <Page121>  
 
121 
 
methodology seeking to generate medium-to-long term average returns of money market plus 4% 
per annum. Allocations are made each month to diversified asset classes including futures on 
benchmark equity indices, benchmark sovereign bonds and bond futures, currencies forwards, 
eligible commodity indices and money market instruments based on an asset allocation model. The 
exposures are further rebalanced in accordance with a dynamic rebalancing methodology that aims 
 to dynamically lock-in returns through active position management. 
Fixed Income Technical 
This portfolio is managed in order to generate cash-plus returns through trading interest rate futures 
 contracts based on certain technical market signals in developed countries’ fixed income markets. 
Fixed Income Macro 
This long/short portfolio is managed in a way that allocates between diverse fixed income assets 
and instruments, including futures on benchmark government bonds and sovereign inflation-linked 
bonds (or indices thereof), based on a fundamental, macro-environment driven quantitative 
 methodology. 
Inflation Alpha 
This long-only portfolio is managed in a way that allocates between fixed income instruments 
(including sovereign bond indices and sovereign inflation-linked bond indices), money markets and 
diversified commodity indices each month seeking to generate diverse portfolio resistant to 
 inflationary uncertainties. 
FX Alpha 
This long-short portfolio is managed in accordance with a is a liquid, diversified quantitative 
methodology that allocates across currency pairs based on a multi-factor approach by combining 
investment in currencies that offer most value in terms of fundamentals with those that offer short 
 term technical upside. 
Equity Alpha 
This long-short portfolio is managed in accordance with a tactical, managed quantitative 
methodology that gains long or short exposure to derivatives on a diverse and liquid basket of listed 
single equities based on the fundamental outlook seeking to benefit from both rising and falling 
 equity markets, volatility and skew. 
Each of the Basket Components may, from time to time, allocate entirely or partially to money 
 market instruments. 
(2) 
The Protection Component 
 
The Protection Component comprises a notional investment in a non-interest bearing deposit 
instrument which would mature on the Scheduled Maturity Date at par. The value of the Protection 
Component, in respect of any Business Day prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date, is determined by 
discounting the notional face value of the Protection Component for the time left to the Scheduled 
Maturity Date using a discount rate calculated by reference to Swiss Franc benchmark interest rate 
swap rates on such Business Day, plus or minus a spread determined in accordance with prevailing 
 market conditions. 
(C) 
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTECTION STRATEGY 
 
The Protection Strategy is a dynamic allocation strategy that algorithmically manages the allocation 
of the Portfolio to the Portfolio Components with the aim of achieving at least the Minimum 
Protection Level on the Scheduled Maturity Date. 
The percentage allocation to any single Portfolio Component will not at any time be greater than 
100% (the "Maximum Allocation") or less than 0% (the "Minimum Allocation") of the Portfolio 
Level. Additionally, the aggregate of the allocation to the Multi-Asset Basket and the Protection 
 Component will always equal 100% of the Portfolio Level. 

 <Page122>  
 
122 
 
 Multiplier, Cushion and Allocation levels 
On each Business Day after the Launch Date, the level of the Portfolio (the "Portfolio Level") is 
calculated as the aggregate of the value of the Multi-Asset Basket and value of the Protection 
Component (weighted by their respective allocations) less all fees and charges (including any 
 Portfolio Replication Costs). 
On each Business Day, the present discounted value of the Minimum Protection Level is 
determined by reference to the time left to the Scheduled Maturity Date and a discount rate 
calculated by reference to benchmark Swiss Franc interest rate curve for such Business Day, plus 
or minus a spread determined in accordance with prevailing market conditions. The percentage 
difference between the Portfolio Level and the present discounted value of the Minimum Protection 
Level (plus any protected fees and costs) determines the cushion level (the "Cushion"). The 
Cushion is used to determine the allocation to the Multi-Asset Basket (the “Basket Allocation”) 
 and to the Protection Component (the “Protection Allocation”) as follows. 
The Basket Allocation depends on a pre-determined multiplication factor (the "Multiplier") which is 
set at target level of 4.0 (“Target Multiplier”). A maximum and minimum range is set around the 
Target Multiplier (“Maximum Multiplier” and “Minimum Multiplier” respectively), such that the 
Maximum Multiplier is set at 4.5 and a Minimum Multiplier is at 3.5. On each Business Day, the 
actual level of the Multiplier ("Actual Multiplier") will be calculated as the ratio of Basket Allocation 
to Cushion on such Business Day. If the Actual Multiplier either exceeds the Maximum Multiplier or 
falls below the Minimum Multiplier, the Portfolio will be rebalanced such that the Basket Allocation 
is targeted to be at a level which is equal to the Cushion multiplied by the Target Multiplier, subject 
to such allocation not being greater than Maximum Allocation or below the Minimum Allocation. 
Thereafter, the Protection Allocation in respect of such Business Day will be set at 100% of the 
 Portfolio Level less the Basket Allocation. 
 Minimum Protection Level 
On the Launch Date, the Minimum Protection Level is set at 100% of the Net Asset Value per Share 
 of the Fund on such date. 
If on any Dealing Day up to and including the Scheduled Maturity Date the Net Asset Value per 
Share of the Fund exceeds the current Minimum Protection Level, a new Minimum Protection Level 
will be set equal to such Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund on such date. As a consequence, 
the allocation to the Multi-Asset Basket may be reduced and the allocation to the Protection 
 Component increased. 
Allocation to the Protection Component shall be made by the Protection Strategy in respect of all 
Classes of Shares in the Fund. The Company has provided Fallback Protection in respect of the 
Class A and Class B Shares, the aim of which is to ensure the Fund has sufficient resources to pay 
the Minimum Protection Level to the holders of Class A and Class B Shares in the event the 
Protection Strategy fails to achieve its objective in allocating appropriate portions of the Portfolio to 
the Protection Component. No Fallback Protection is available in respect of the Class C Shares. If 
the Protection Strategy does fail to meet its objective, the Fund will not provide the holders of Class 
 C Shares with principal protection and they may receive less than the Minimum Protection Level. 
 Lock-in Trigger Event 
On any Business Day, if the Minimum Protection Level is sufficiently high, or due to negative 
performance of the Multi-Asset Basket, the Cushion may fall to a level at or below a certain 
minimum level (“Minimum Cushion”), expected to be at 3% (such event a "Lock-in Trigger 
Event"). Upon the occurrence of a Lock-in Trigger Event the Portfolio will, for all Classes of Shares, 
be allocated 100% to the Protection Component and the allocation to the Multi-Asset Basket will 
 fall to 0%, and will continue to be so until the Scheduled Maturity Date. 
For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of a Lock-in Trigger Event, the allocation of the 

 <Page123>  
 
123 
 
Portfolio fully to the Protection Component may result in holders of Class C Shares receiving less 
than the Minimum Protection Level, including less than the value of their initial investment, at the 
 Scheduled Maturity Date. 
(D) 
PORTFOLIO REPLICATION COSTS 
 
The performance of the Portfolio will be calculated net of various replication costs in respect of the 
Portfolio Components and such costs may include, but not be limited to, trading and administrative 
costs of hedging, transactional charges, collateral costs (see the section titled “Use of Derivative 
Contracts”), brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads and licensing fees (“Portfolio 
   Replication Costs”).

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
Certain risks relating to the Shares are set out under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus. 
 In addition, Shareholders should note that: 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE 
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
 ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND IS TO PROVIDE THE INVESTORS WITH A 
RETURN LINKED TO THE PORTFOLIO. THE FUND IS PRINCIPAL PROTECTED UNDER 
CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT IT IS NOT GUARANTEED. 
 
(a) 
The Net Asset Value per Share may be less than the original value of your investment 
under certain circumstances and you should be prepared to sustain a loss on your 
investment. An investment in the Fund involves investment risks, including possible 
loss of the amount invested. The capital return and income of the Fund are based on 
the capital appreciation and income on the investments it holds, less expenses 
incurred. Therefore, the Fund's return may be expected to fluctuate in response to 
changes in such capital appreciation or income. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
The Protection Strategy is designed to ensure that the assets of the Fund are sufficient 
to provide investors with redemption proceeds equal to at least the Minimum Protection 
Level on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date. Therefore, if the investment objective is 
achieved, investors who redeem their Shares on or after the Scheduled Maturity Date 
are expected to receive a redemption amount per Share at least equal to the Minimum 
Protection Level. However, if an investor redeems Shares prior to the Scheduled 
Maturity Date, the Net Asset Value of such Shares may be less than the Minimum 
Protection Level and such investor may therefore receive less than the Minimum 
Protection Level. 
 
(e) 
However if the Protection Strategy fails to achieve its objective, Share Class C will not 
benefit from the principal protection granted through Derivatives Contracts. 
 
(f) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(g) 
Exposure to all or part of the Underlying may be achieved through an investment in the 
Swaps. Given the nature of the Swaps and the costs that may be involved in their 
utilisation, the value of the Swaps (which may ultimately determine the return the 
Shareholders will receive) may not exactly track the value of the relevant part of the 
Underlying. Shareholders should thus be familiar with the risks associated with such 
an approach to investment. 
 
(h) 
The commodity asset class tends to have higher volatility and downside risk compared 
to traditional asset classes like bonds and equities. The Underlying, although 

 <Page125>  
 
125 
 
 diversified, does have some exposure to commodities. 
(i) 
The Swaps may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon the occurrence of 
certain events with respect to either the Approved Counterparty or the Fund (including 
failure to pay, insolvency and the imposition of withholding tax on the payments due 
by either party). Upon such termination, the Fund or the Approved Counterparty may 
be liable to make a termination payment (regardless of which party may have caused 
such termination) based on the mark to market value of the Swaps at such time, as 
determined by the Approved Counterparty. 
 
(j) 
The return payable under the OTC FDIs is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank 
PLC as Approved Counterparty and is collateralised to the extent required by the Law. 
In addition, Barclays Bank PLC, or any successor entity to which the index products 
team of Barclays Bank PLC may be transferred which is acceptable to the Investment 
Manager, may act as the calculation agent and/or index sponsor for proprietary indices 
to which the Underlying may be allocated. Shareholders should note that in such case 
not only will they be exposed to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC but also to 
potential conflicts of interest in the performance of these functions by Barclays Bank 
PLC. In such circumstances, Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to use its reasonable 
endeavours to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to its 
respective obligations and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the Company and 
the Shareholders are not unfairly prejudiced. The Directors believe that Barclays Bank 
PLC is suitable and competent to perform such functions. 
 
(k) 
Certain types of assets such as Derivative Contracts may be illiquid, particularly during 
adverse market conditions, and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(l) 
The sub-funds of the Company are segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as 
such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the 
liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be noted that the Company is a single 
legal entity which may operate or have assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims 
in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily recognise such segregation. There can 
be no guarantee that the courts of any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the 
limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
(m) 
There is a considerable likelihood that subsequent to a Lock-in Trigger Event, the 
Cushion may not increase sufficiently, and the Portfolio may continue to be allocated 
entirely to the Protection Asset until the Scheduled Maturity Date. 
 
(n) 
Some of the Fund Assets are denominated in currencies other than the Base Currency 
of the Fund. The Fund may utilize different FDIs for to seek to hedge against declines 
in the Fund Assets as a result of changes in currency exchange rates or interest 
rates. While it is not the intention of the Fund, it is possible that over-hedged or under-
hedged positions may arise from time-to-time due to factors outside the control of the 
Investment Manager, and will therefore affect the Net Asset Value of the Fund. 
 
(o) 
The Portfolio follows the Protection Strategy, a dynamic allocation strategy that 
algorithmically manages the allocation of the Portfolio to the Portfolio Components with 
the aim of achieving at least the Minimum Protection Level on the Scheduled Maturity 
Date. Therefore investors are accepting that their investment shall be exposed to this 
particular determined Protection Strategy and acknowledge that the performance of 
the Portfolio (and, consequently, the Fund) will depend on the Protection Strategy. In 
addition, investors should note as the Protection Strategy is a predetermined 
methodology, it may be the case that the Portfolio is not exposed to the best performing 
assets or instruments. 
 
(p) 
Under the Protection Strategy, in order to protect the higher Minimum Protection Level 
set on a Dealing Day, or during any periods of negative performance of the Multi-Asset 

 <Page126>  
 
126 
 
Basket, the allocation of the Portfolio to the Multi-Asset Basket may be reduced and, 
conversely, the allocation to the Protection Component may be increased. 
Consequently if, following such reduction in exposure, the Strategies constituting the 
Multi-Asset Basket perform positively, the Portfolio will benefit less from such positive 
performance than would have been the case had the exposure to the Multi-Asset 
Basket not been reduced. 
 
(q) 
The holders of Class A and Class B Shares should note that all of the assets 
comprising the Fund will be available to meet all of the liabilities of the Fund, regardless 
of the different amounts stated to be payable on the separate Classes. Class C Shares 
do not benefit from the Derivative Contract with the Approved Counterparty, the aim of 
which is to provide the Fund with sufficient assets to pay the Class A and Class B 
Shareholders the Minimum Protection Level if the Protection Strategy fails to meet its 
objective. In the event the Protection Strategy does fail to meet its objective, the 
holders of Class C Shares are exposed to a higher risk of price fluctuation and there is 
a greater risk that the amounts payable by the Fund in respect of the Class C Shares 
may exceed the value of the assets allocated to the Class C Shares. 
 
(r) 
Any Repo Transaction may be terminated in accordance with its terms upon the 
occurrence of certain events with respect to either the Repo Counterparty or the Fund 
(including failure to pay or insolvency). Upon such termination, the default market value 
of the securities which are the subject of the Repo Transaction will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the relevant Repo Transaction and a payment settling 
each party's claim against the other under such Repo Transaction will, based on such 
determination, be made by either the Repo Counterparty or the Fund. From this point 
on (1) the Fund will take ownership of such securities and therefore will be exposed to 
the market risk of these securities and (2) there is no further obligation on the Repo 
Counterparty to repurchase equivalent securities and/or to deliver to the Fund 
additional equivalent securities if the market value of the securities decreases.

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its Investment Objective, as defined below. 
Investors should note that emerging market equities tend to have higher volatility compared 
to other equities. Also, emerging markets can be relatively less liquid and are prone to 
frequent disruptions, higher bid-offer spreads, and limitations on trading and investment 
 imposed by law or regulatory authorities. 
Exposure to emerging market equities is expected to be obtained in local currency which 
the Investment Manager does not intend to hedge back into the Base Currency of the Fund, 
hence leading to potentially more volatile returns for the Fund. Furthermore, the local 
currencies in which the relevant Emerging Market Equities exposure has been obtained, 
 may not always be freely convertible into the Base Currency. 
The Fund is not capital protected nor guaranteed. An investment in the Fund should not 
constitute a substantial proportion of an investment portfolio and may not be appropriate 
 for all investors. 
Certain risks attached to an investment in the Fund are set out in the Prospectus in the 
section "Risk Factors" and also in the section "OTHER INFORMATION - Risk Factors" of 
 this Supplement. 
 Suitability of Investment 
You should inform yourself as to (a) the possible tax consequences, (b) the legal and 
regulatory requirements, (c) any foreign exchange restrictions or exchange control 
requirements and (d) any other requisite governmental or other consents or formalities 
which you might encounter under the laws of the country of your citizenship, residence or 
 domicile and which might be relevant to your purchase, holding or disposal of the Shares. 
The value of the Shares may go up or down and if you dispose of your shares you may not 
get back the amount you have invested. See the section headed "Risk Factors" of the 
Prospectus and the section headed "OTHER INFORMATION - Risk Factors" in this 
 Supplement for a discussion of certain risks that should be considered by you. 
An investment in the Shares is only suitable for you if you (either alone or with the help of an

 Renminbi or RMB means the currency of the PRC; 
 Shanghai Stock Connect means the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program; 
 Shenzhen Stock Connect means the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect program; 
Stock Connect means the Shanghai Stock Connect and the Shenzhen Stock Connect. Stock 
Connect is a securities trading and clearing linked program developed by the Hong Kong 
Exchanges and Clearing Limited (“HKEX”), the Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”), the Shenzhen 
Stock Exchange (“SZSE”) and the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited 
(“ChinaClear”) with an aim to achieve the mutual stock market access between the PRC and Hong 
Kong. The Shanghai Stock Connect and the Shenzhen Stock Connect are operated independently 
from each other, but are similar in respect to the fundamental principles, operational mechanism 
 and regulatory framework.  
The Stock Connect comprises a Northbound trading link and a Southbound trading link. Under the 
Northbound trading link, Hong Kong and overseas investors, such as the Fund, through its Hong 
Kong brokers and a securities trading service company established by the Stock Exchange of Hong 
Kong Limited (“SEHK”), respectively in Shanghai (for trading under the Shanghai Stock Connect) 
and Shenzhen (for trading under the Shenzhen Stock Connect), may be able to trade certain 
eligible China A-Shares listed on SSE/SZSE by routing orders to SSE/SZSE. Under the 
Southbound trading link, investors in the PRC will be able to trade certain stocks listed on SEHK. 
Under a joint announcement issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) and the 
China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) on 10 November 2014, the Shanghai Stock 
Connect commenced trading on 17 November 2014. The Shenzhen Stock Connect commenced 
 trading on 5 December 2016. 
Under the Stock Connect, the Fund, through its Hong Kong brokers may trade certain eligible 
shares listed on SSE/SZSE. As for trading on SSE, the eligible China A-Shares include all the 
constituent stocks from time to time of the SSE 180 Index and the SSE 380 Index, and all the SSE 
listed A-Shares that are not included as constituent stocks of the relevant indices but which have 
corresponding H-Shares listed on SEHK (companies that issue both A-Shares on SSE/SZSE and 
H-Shares on SEHK are referred to as “A+H Shares Companies”). As for trading on SZSE, the 
eligible China A-Shares include all constituent shares of the SZSE Constituent Index and the SZSE 
Small/Mid Cap Innovation Index issued by a company with a market capitalisation of RMB6 billion 
or above, and China A-Shares issued by A+H Shares Companies listed on SZSE. SSE/SZSE-
listed shares which are not traded in RMB and SSE/SZSE-listed shares which are included in the 
“risk alert board” are explicitly excluded from the eligible shares under the Stock Connect. It is 
expected that the list of eligible securities will be subject to review and adjustment (in particular, 
 the adjustment along with the changes of the constituent China A-Shares in the relevant indices). 
The Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (“HKSCC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
HKEX, and ChinaClear are responsible for the clearing, settlement and the provision of depository, 
nominee and other related services of the trades executed by their respective market participants 
and investors. The China A-Shares traded through the Stock Connect are issued in scripless form, 
 and investors will not hold any physical China A-Shares. 
Although HKSCC does not claim proprietary interests in the SSE/SZSE securities held in its 
omnibus stock account in ChinaClear, ChinaClear as the share registrar for SSE/SZSE listed 
companies will still treat HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions in 
respect of such SSE/SZSE securities. Stock Connect trades are settled in RMB and investors must 
 have timely access to a reliable supply of RMB in Hong Kong, which cannot be guaranteed. 
In addition to paying trading fees, levies and stamp duties in connection with trading in the China 
A-Shares, the Fund investing via the Stock Connect may be subject to new fees arising from trading 
of the China A-Shares via the Stock Connect which are yet to be determined and announced by 
the relevant authorities.

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The investment objective (the “Investment Objective”) of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with 
long-term capital appreciation through exposure in local currencies to a portfolio of Emerging 
 Market Equities meeting certain sustainable investment criteria. 
The portfolio of Emerging Market Equities is constructed and rebalanced by the Investment 
Manager based on the investment allocation advice provided periodically by the Allocation Advisor 
in accordance with the terms of an allocation advisory agreement, and pursuant to the Allocation 
 Advisor’s proprietary sustainable investment philosophy. 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the Investment Objective. The Fund is 
neither capital protected nor guaranteed. Prospective investors should read the section 
titled "Risk Factors" below and also the section of the Prospectus titled "Risk Factors" for 
 a description of certain risks associated with an investment in the Fund. 
 Investment Policy 
In order to achieve the investment objective, the Company, on behalf of the Fund, may invest the 
net proceeds of any issue of Shares (whether on the Launch Date or subsequently) in one or more 
of the following instruments: 
 
(i) 
Emerging Market Equities that are admitted to official listing on a stock exchange, 
or traded on Other Regulated Markets which are authorised pursuant to the UCITS 
Regulations, including - without limitation – Russian and Chinese markets in 
respect of which investors’ attention should be drawn to the related specific risks 
as further disclosed in section “Risks related to investment in Emerging Markets – 
items f and g” below; 
 
(ii) 
global currencies. Exposure to Emerging Market Equities is expected to be effected 
in the relevant local currencies, and is not expected to be hedged back in to the 
Base Currency. Ancillary cash in relation to the exposure to Emerging Market 
Equities may also be held in the form of cash deposits denominated in local 
currencies;  
 
(iii) 
Money Market Instruments in the form of deposits or instruments linked to indices, 
the returns of which are linked to a short-term money market benchmark and/or 
short-dated fixed and floating-rate government bonds (rated at least “A-” by 
Standard and Poor’s or equivalent) issued by OECD countries;  
 
(iv) 
transferable securities in the form of exchange traded notes or certificates 
(collateralised securities linked to indices and traded on exchanges). The relevant 
exchange traded notes or certificates may not necessarily be admitted to official 
listing on EU Member or OECD listed stock exchange and/or regulated markets 
but on Other Regulated Markets in non-OECD Member State;  
 
(v) 
FDIs in the form of Futures, Forwards, Options and/or Swaps (please see “Use of 
Derivative Contracts” section below). Forwards and Swaps (either funded or 
unfunded) will be entered into with an Approved Counterparty. Options may be 
traded on the relevant exchange (which may not necessarily be in an OECD 
Member State) or over-the-counter with an Approved Counterparty. Futures may 
be traded on the relevant exchange (which may not necessarily be in an OECD 

 <Page134>  
 
134 
 
Member State); 
 
(vi) 
CIS including (but not limited to) ETFs.  
 
The above instruments, any ancillary cash held by the Fund and any instruments used for efficient 
 portfolio management shall constitute the “Fund Assets” for the purposes of the Prospectus. 
In order to achieve the investment objective through the use of the Swaps, the Fund may incur 
 certain charges (“Replication Costs”) as further described in “Use of Derivative Contracts”. 
The Approved Counterparty to the Swaps will be required under the terms of the relevant derivative 
contract to provide collateral to the Company so that the Company's risk exposure to the relevant 
 Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent required by the Law. 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day in order to determine 
 the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out in the Prospectus. 
 The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. 
Further information relevant to the Fund’s investment policy is contained in the main part of the 
 Prospectus under “Investment Objectives and Policies” and under “Investment Restrictions”. 
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor seeking exposure to emerging market equities and capital 
 appreciation and who is prepared to accept a medium to high degree of volatility. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The subscription price and the Repurchase Price at which a Share will be subscribed for or 
repurchased, as the case may be, on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant 
Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with any applicable Preliminary 
Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge and in accordance with the provisions of this 
 section. Subscriptions and redemptions will be effected in cash or in specie. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day: (a) as the value of the Fund 
Assets will increase or decrease over time by reference to the performance of the Portfolio; (b) as 
the fees and expenses in relation to the Fund will accrue over time; (c) due to dealing charges, 
taxes and other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and 
 (d) due to the payments of any dividend. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class for subscription or repurchase may be adjusted respectively 
in accordance with the Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no dealing 
in the Fund or Share Class on the relevant Dealing Day, the subscription price or the Repurchase 
Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share Class rounded downwards to such number 
 of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
Accordingly, you should note that the Net Asset Value per Share Class in respect of a 
repurchase of Shares at any time may be less than the original value of your investment, 
        and you should be prepared to sustain a loss on your investment.

The examples shown in the table assume that the Fund holds only Fund Assets and ancillary cash 
and is collateralised to the extent required by the Law and applicable regulations, and is receiving 
the performance of the Portfolio pursuant to the relevant Fund Assets, including FDIs (see “Use of 
Derivative Contracts” below). It also assumes a constant investment with no additional 
 subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without deduction of any dividends, fees or expenses. 
 Use of Derivative Contracts 
The Fund may gain exposure to certain assets in the Portfolio through FDIs (including futures, 
forwards, options and/or swaps). They may also be used for efficient portfolio management 
 purposes, as further detailed under “Currency Hedging”. 
FDIs such as forwards, interest rate swaps, securities with embedded derivatives options and 
futures, may also be used to hedge the exposure of the Portfolio to interest rates, equities, 
 currencies and other risks.  
With respect to funded OTC derivative contract (including funded swap), the Fund will pay an 
upfront amount to the relevant Approved Counterparty in exchange for such Approved 
Counterparty paying a return linked to the relevant instrument. With respect to unfunded swaps, 
there will be no upfront payment. The Approved Counterparty pays a return linked to the 
performance of the relevant underlying asset subject to any funding costs. Forwards and options 
 will be cash settled at their termination or maturity.  
Each Approved Counterparty to the OTC Derivatives will be required to provide collateral to the 
Company if the exposure of the Fund to such Approved Counterparty exceeds certain limits so that 
the Company's risk exposure to the relevant Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent 
required by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
 Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs may be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events with respect to either the Fund 
or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event of default (such as a failure to 
pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event (which is not the fault of either 
party, for example, illegality or a tax event) or a disruption event. In such case the derivative contract 
will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter into new FDIs with 
 other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the underlying assets. 
The Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with the Authority. 
The Fund will only invest in FDIs in accordance with its risk management policy agreed with 

 <Page136>  
 
136 
 
the Authority. The Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative 
limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of 
 the main categories of investments. 
 Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that the Fund does not use TRS.  
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
 The Investment Manager does NOT intend to hedge the currency exposure of the Fund Assets. 
 Disruption Events  
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good faith, 
make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets. The Net Asset 
Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 
 
(ii) the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value”; and/or 
 
(iii) the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in the 
Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
 
 Investment Restrictions 
The Fund will not invest more than 10% of its net assets in units of other UCITS or other Collective 
 Investment Schemes. 
The general investment restrictions set out under "Funds – Investment Restrictions" in the 
 Prospectus shall apply to the Fund. 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will solely be entitled to look to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each derivative contract (including, but not limited to, repurchase agreements) may contain limited 
recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company in respect of any claims arising 
under or in relation to such derivative contracts are expressed to be limited to the Fund Assets, and 
an Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the Company. If following 
the realisation of the Fund Assets and the application of such realisation proceeds in payment of 
all claims of an Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the 
 Company  
ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such claims are 
not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically 
extinguished, (b) an Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof 

 <Page137>  
 
137 
 
and (c) an Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company as 
 a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. The Fund will not borrow for investment 
purposes. 
 Leverage 
The Fund is not intended to be leveraged for investment purposes.  
The Fund's potential use of leverage will be in accordance with the commitment approach and its 
 global exposure through the use of FDIs will not exceed total value of the Fund’s assets. 
 Dividend Policy 
 There are no dividend entitlements for the Shares.

of the Fund. The Investment Manager may pay out of its fees the fees of the Allocation 
Advisor. Neither the Management Company, the Investment Manager, the Investment Advisor, 
the Sub-Distributor, the Allocation Advisor or any third party will be entitled to be reimbursed out of 
 the assets of the Fund for their respective out-of-pocket expenses. 
In addition, Fixed Fees will be charged on the Fund. Fixed Fees means the fees payable by the 
Company for each Fund in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by that Fund 
that include Transaction Fees and Administrative Expenses (including the Administrator and 
Depositary’s Fees, the Setting-Up Costs and other Administrative Expenses). In particular, the 
Administrator and Depositary are entitled to charge a global Administrator and Depositary Fee of a

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PORTFOLIO 
 
 
(A) 
Portfolio 
 
The Portfolio comprises allocations to Emerging Market Equities, with a residual allocation to cash 
 and short-dated government bonds. 
The Investment Manager gains exposure to the relevant Emerging Market Equities on a best efforts 
basis and in its sole and absolute discretion, based on the allocation advice provided from time to 
time by the Allocation Advisor in the form of a list (”Target Equities List”) of Emerging Market 
 Equities with target weightings. 
Exposure to any Emerging Market Equity may be achieved through direct holding of equities, 
transferable securities, through CIS (including ETFs) or FDIs providing exposure to one or more 
 Emerging Market Equities. 
Emerging Market Equities do not necessarily trade on their home exchanges, and instead may be 
admitted to trading on a regulated exchange in another jurisdiction, including but not limited to the 
 exchanges of the UK and the US. 
The Portfolio’s composition is expected to be amended by the Investment Manager on each 
Rebalancing Date, based on the rebalancing of the Target Equities List proposed by the Allocation 
 Advisor and subject to certain regulatory and/or operational limitations. 
Due to certain constraints (including, but not limited to, local exchange controls, adverse financial 
market conditions, adverse changes in the political situation of certain emerging market countries) 
or for any other reason it deems appropriate in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders, the 
Investment Manager may also, at any time between successive Rebalancing Dates, modify the 
composition of the Portfolio, including putting in place hedging arrangements with respect to some 
or all of the constituents of the Portfolio, or even by no allocation to the Emerging Market Equities. 
Where the exposure to some or all of the constituents of the Portfolio is reduced to zero, the Fund 
may invest the balance in Money Market Instruments and/or fixed income securities in the form of 
short-dated government bonds. Such reduction in exposure to Emerging Market Equities shall be 
on a temporary basis, while such constraints are continuing (as determined by the Investment 
 Manager in its sole discretion). 
Any dividends, net of any taxes applicable, received by virtue of holding any of the constituents of 
the Portfolio may be reinvested or held in Money Market Instruments until the next Rebalancing 
 Date. 
On each Rebalancing Date, the combined aggregate exposures to assets comprising the Portfolio 
will not exceed 100% of the value of the Net Asset Value of the Fund. Any proceeds not invested 
in Emerging Market Equity exposures may be invested in cash deposits denominated in local 
 currencies, Money Market Instruments and/or short-dated government bonds. 
(B) 
Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology 
 
The sustainable investing allocation methodology (the “Sustainable Investing Allocation 
Methodology”) is a discretionary stock selection process implemented by the Allocation Advisor in 
accordance with sustainable investment criteria, with the aim of providing a quarterly investment 
 recommendation to the Investment Manager.  
Emerging Market Equities are regularly reviewed and selected by the Allocation Advisor, using 
sustainability investing research obtained from an independent provider appointed by the Allocation 

 <Page141>  
 
141 
 
Advisor. The companies are assessed on the basis of how they operate, how they are governed 
and their impact on society against criteria derived from three themes: ‘Environment’, ‘Society’ and 
‘Governance’. The companies are then ranked by the Allocation Adviser by sector and/or industry 
 peer groups.  
The Allocation Advisor then uses securities research to assess the financial soundness of the 
companies offering the best performance on the three themes to construct the Target Equities List. 
In doing so, the Allocation Advisor will also take into account a number of factors including, but not 
 limited to, the potential impact of local taxes on dividends. 
The Target Equities List is submitted by the Allocation Advisor to the Investment Manager who may 
then decide which exposures to Emerging Market Equities it may implement and how such 
exposures should be obtained, taking into consideration a number of factors including (but not 
limited to) regulatory and operational aspects. Where the exposure to some or all of the constituents 
of the Portfolio is reduced to zero, the Fund may invest the remaining balance in Money Market 
 Instruments and/or fixed income securities in the form of short-dated government bonds. 
Although the Target Equities List is expected to be diversified from both an economic sector and a 
geographical point of view, there is no guarantee that the Target Equities List (or the resulting 
Portfolio) will present such diversification. However, the list will in any case be sufficiently diversified 
 to comply with the investment restrictions imposed by the Law and any other applicable regulations. 
 The Target Equities List is not expected to change materially from one quarter to the next. 
(C) 
Disclosures for the SFDR 
 
The purpose of this section is to provide certain disclosures for the purposes of the SFDR in relation 
 to the Fund. 
1 
The environmental and social characteristics promoted by the Fund 
 
1.1 
The Fund has been categorised as meeting the provisions set out in Article 8 of SFDR for 
products which promote environmental and social characteristics, as further described 
below. 
 
1.2 
Among other characteristics, the characteristics promoted by this Fund is to seek to invest 
substantially all of the Fund’s assets in companies recommended for the portfolio in light of 
their alignment with the Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology. Such Sustainable 
Investing 
Allocation 
Methodology 
can 
be 
found 
on 
https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/investments/types-of-investing/portfolio-
management/sustainabilityguidelines.html. 
 
2 
What investment strategy does the Fund follow to seek to meet the promotion of the 
environmental and social characteristics of the Fund? 
 
2.1 
As set out in sub-section B of the section of this Supplement headed ‘General Description of 
the Portfolio’, the Allocation Advisor adopts a Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology, 
which is a discretionary stock selection process implemented by the Allocation Advisor in 
 accordance with certain sustainable investment criteria. 
2.2 
As described in sub-section B of the section of this Supplement headed ‘General Description 
of the Portfolio’, the Allocation Advisor will formulate the Target Equities List based on, 
among other things, the Allocation Advisor’s assessment of (i) the financial soundness of the 
relevant companies reviewed and (ii) its assessment of such companies against sustainable 
 investment criteria using its Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology. 

 <Page142>  
 
142 
 
2.3 
The Emerging Market Equities in which the Fund invests (directly and indirectly through the 
use of CIS, ETFs and/or FDIs) are, typically, selected by the Investment Manager from the 
 Target Equities List provided to it by the Allocation Advisor. 
2.4 
The Allocation Advisor’s Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology requires the 
Allocation Advisor to provide recommendations to the Investment Manager (in the form of 
the Target Equities List) using the following process: 
 
(A) Apply a series of product type exclusions 
 
As standard, the Allocation Advisor checks whether a company meets its Sustainable 
Investing Allocation Methodology and excludes companies that manufacture certain 
products, such as controversial weapons or violate the United Nations Global Compact. In 
addition, the Allocation Advisor excludes any company if more than 5% of its turnover 
•  relates to: 
cannabis; 
• 
pornography; 
• 
fur and controversial animal skins; 
• 
mining; 
• 
addictive gambling services, such as casinos, gaming machines and online betting; 
• 
animal testing unless this is required by law and done in the least harmful way; and 
• 
genetically modified organisms. 
 
Furthermore, the Allocation Adviser excludes any company if more than 25% of its turnover 
relates to the generation of electricity from thermal coal. The Allocation Advisor may, in its 
discretion, elect to apply additional product type exclusions over time that it believes are 
consistent with its Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology. Such additional 
exclusions (together with the exclusion policy document) will be disclosed as they are 
implemented 
on 
https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/investments/types-of-
 investing/portfolio-management/sustainabilityguidelines.html. 
(B) apply a series of process exclusions  
 
The Allocation Advisor then excludes companies that are involved in controversial 
practices and do not have a policy on these practices. For instance, controversial energy 
extraction, such as drilling in the Arctic, shale gas extraction, otherwise known as fracking, 
and oil extraction from tar sands, as well as companies which produce, sell or distribute 
cluster munitions or crucial parts thereof (as mentioned in Article 2 of the Convention on 
Cluster Munitions (Dublin, May 30th 2008)). Companies that generate more than 5% of 
 their revenues through these practices are excluded 
The Allocation Advisor may, in its discretion, elect to apply additional process exclusions 
over time that it believes are consistent with its Sustainable Investing Allocation 
Methodology. Such additional exclusions (together with the exclusion policy document) will 
be 
disclosed 
as 
they 
are 
implemented 
on 
https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/investments/types-of-investing/portfolio-
         management/sustainabilityguidelines.html. 

 <Page143>  
 
143 
 
(C) Establish an “ESG Rating” for a universe of in-scope companies  
 
The Allocation Advisor obtains sustainability investing research from a specialist 
independent research provider to allow it to give companies an ESG rating. This research 
assesses companies on the basis of how they operate, how they are governed and their 
impact on society against criteria derived from three themes: ‘Environment’, ‘Society’ and 
•  ‘Governance’. In particular the research looks at the following: 
Environmental 
 
What efforts does a company make to reduce carbon emissions, water usage and the 
amount of waste generated?  
What is the company’s profile and commitment to recycling?  
•  Does the company report on its own environmental impact? 
Social 
 
Does a company ensure working conditions are safe for its employees? 
Does a company ensure it pays its employees a fair wage?  
Does the company have a discrimination policy?  
•  Does a company impose similar obligations through its supply chain? 
Governance 
 
Is the company susceptible to corruption?  
Who is on the Supervisory Board?  
Does the company lobby the government?  
 How transparent is the company on its policy and activities? 
The ESG rating is therefore based on data concerning the environment, society and good 
governance. In the first place, this involves an assessment of a company's material 
sustainability risks. These depend on, among other things, which sector a company 
operates in. The second step is to examine how a company manages these risks. For 
example, better governance can lower Sustainability Risk. The best rated companies may 
therefore be viewed as having positive sustainability characteristics. 
 
2.5 
Having applied these processes, the Allocation Advisor provides a list of Emerging Market 
 Equities which are used to constitute the Target Equities List. 
2.6 
Whilst the Investment Manager retains complete discretion in respect of the investment 
management of the Fund (subject to the overall control and supervision of the Management 
Company and the Directors), in practice the Investment Manager will typically follow the 
recommendations provided to it by the Allocation Advisor and is bound by the parameters of 
the investment objective and policy of the Fund, which is to is to provide Shareholders with 
long-term capital appreciation through exposure in local currencies to a portfolio of Emerging 
Market Equities meeting certain sustainable investment criteria. . The implementation of 
such recommendations therefore creates a Portfolio of Emerging Market Equities (whether 
directly or indirectly) that are considered to promote the environmental and/or social 
 characteristics described above. 
2.7 
The Investment Manager integrates Sustainability Risks into its investment decision-making 
process through the advice received from the Allocation Advisor and accounts for these 
views in determining valuation, asset selection, portfolio construction, and ongoing 
investment monitoring and portfolio management. In doing so, the Investment Manager gives 
due consideration to the relevance and potential materiality of Sustainability Risks for the 
portfolio as a whole in the context of the investment objective. Sustainability Risks may 
negatively impact the value of a company included in the Target Equities List. In order to 

 <Page144>  
 
144 
 
mitigate these risks, the Investment Manager may sell or underweight a security, or make 
adjustments to the top-down allocations to geographies, sectors, or asset classes.  
 
The Allocation Advisor Agent then overlays a Sustainability Risk assessment for each in-
scope company. The Allocation Advisor assesses a company’s material Sustainability Risk. 
This is a subjective risk assessment by the Allocation Advisor, as the risks differ depending 
on, among other things, which sector a company operates in. For instance, the material 
Sustainability Risks of an oil company will differ from those of a clothing manufacturer. The 
Allocation Advisor then examines how a company manages these Sustainability Risks, as 
the Allocation Advisor is of the view that better governance can have an effect of lowering 
 the overall Sustainability Risk of a company. 
2.8 
The Investment Manager seeks to invest substantially all of the Fund’s assets in the 
companies included in the Target Equities List. However, there may be times that the Fund 
invests in cash, cash equivalents or money market instruments. These investments do not 
have an environment or social characteristic or are qualified as sustainable but at times, are 
necessary investments to ensure efficient management of the Fund. 
 
(D) 
Replication Costs 
 
The performance of the Portfolio will be calculated net of various replication costs in respect of the 
Portfolio Components and such costs may include, but not be limited to, trading and administrative 
costs of hedging, transactional charges, collateral costs (see the section titled “Use of Derivative 
 Contracts”), brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads and licensing fees. 
(E) 
Advisory Costs 
 
The Investment Manager may pay out of its fees (and not out of the assets of the Fund) the fees 
    of the Allocation Advisor.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
Certain risks relating to the Shares are set out under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus. 
 In addition, Shareholders should note that: 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE 
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
 ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND IS TO PROVIDE THE INVESTORS WITH A 
 RETURN LINKED TO THE PORTFOLIO. 
General Risks related to Investment in the Fund 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to a Portfolio” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
The Fund is a sub-fund of the Company. The sub-funds of the Company are segregated 
as a matter of Luxembourg law and as such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund 
will not be available to satisfy the liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be 
noted that the Company is a single legal entity which may operate or have assets held 
on its behalf or be subject to claims in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily 
recognise such segregation. There can be no guarantee that the courts of any 
jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
 Market Risks 
(a) 
Emerging Market Equities may not necessarily be admitted to official listing on EU 
Member or OECD listed stock exchange and/or regulated markets 
 
(b) 
The Fund’s performance is related to the performance of the Fund Assets. The Fund is 
therefore exposed to general market movements and trends in money market, Emerging 
Market Equities (as defined above), and currencies, which are occasionally partially 
affected by irrational factors. Such factors may lead to a more significant and longer 
lasting decline in prices affecting the entire market. 
 
(c) 
In the occurrence of any market disruption events, foreign exchange disruptions, change 
in law, issuer tax event, hedging disruption, or currency disruption event, the Fund may 
also be disrupted. This disruption may lead to a possible termination of the Fund and 
Shareholders will therefore receive the net proceeds of the assets of the Fund. 
 
(d) 
In the event of a merger event, tender offer, nationalisation, insolvency or delisting of 
any of the constituents of the Portfolio, or if an event occurs that may have a diluting or 

 <Page146>  
 
146 
 
concentrative effect of the theoretical value of the Portfolio, the Investment Manager 
may adjust the Portfolio by reducing the allocation to a constituent of the Portfolio, 
substituting any constituent of the Portfolio, or taking any other action as is deemed 
necessary to achieve the Investment Objective of the Fund. 
 
Strategy and Investment Risks 
 
(a) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its Investment Objective. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that any or all of the investment advice provided by the Allocation 
Advisor will be implemented. The Investment Manager may reject any or all advice of 
the Investment Adviser in its sole discretion. Implementation may also be adversely 
affected by the market conditions, as well as economic, legal, operational or other 
factors which may, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, have a negative impact 
on the Fund. 
 
(c) 
The Investment Manager retains certain discretion in respect of the application of 
Sustainable Investing Allocation Methodology to determine the composition of the 
Portfolio, as disclosed in the section “General Description of the Portfolio – Sustainable 
Investing Allocation Methodology”. While such discretion will be exercised by the 
Investment Manager with a view to achieve the Investment Objective of the Fund, there 
is no assurance that the Investment Objective will always be achieved. 
 
(d) 
The Fund will be subject to certain costs, including transaction costs (which may include, 
without limitation, a buy-sell spread) when investing in certain constituents of the 
Portfolio, as disclosed in the section on ‘Replication Costs’. Such costs will affect the 
Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund. 
 
Risks related to investment in Emerging Markets 
 
(a) 
The Fund may invest in emerging market securities or currencies either directly or 
indirectly via CIS, ETFs, and/or FDIs. Investment in emerging markets may increase the 
volatility of the Fund’s Net Asset Value. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund’s Shares 
may be worth more or less on redemption than their original purchase value.  
 
(b) 
Investing in emerging markets involves additional risks and special considerations not 
typically associated with investing in other more established economies or securities 
markets. Such risks may include (1) restrictions on foreign investment and on 
repatriation of capital invested in emerging markets, (2) currency fluctuations, (3) 
potential price volatility and lesser liquidity of securities traded in emerging markets, (4) 
economic and political risks, including the risk of nationalization or expropriation of 
assets or confiscatory taxation, (5) risks related to custodial arrangements and delays 
or other factors in the settlement of securities transactions, and (6) accounting, auditing, 
financial and other reporting standards in emerging markets may not be equivalent to 
those in more developed markets. Many of the laws that govern private investment, 
securities transactions and other contractual relationships in emerging countries are 
new and largely untested. As a result, the Fund may be subject to a number of unusual 
risks, including inadequate investor protection, contradictory legislation, incomplete, 
unclear and changing laws, ignorance or breaches of regulations on the part of other 
market participants, lack of established or effective avenues for legal redress, lack of 
standard practices and confidentiality customs characteristic of developed markets and 
lack of enforcement of existing regulations. Furthermore, it may be difficult to obtain and 
enforce a judgment in certain of the emerging countries in which assets of the Fund are 
invested. This difficulty in protecting and enforcing rights may have a material adverse 
effect on the Fund and its operations should an enforcement situation arise.  
 
(c) 
Regulatory controls and corporate governance of companies in emerging market 
countries often confer little protection on minority shareholders. Anti-fraud and anti-

 <Page147>  
 
147 
 
insider trading legislation is often rudimentary. The concept of fiduciary duty to 
shareholders by officers and directors is also limited when compared to such concepts 
in developed markets. In certain instances management may take significant actions 
without the consent of shareholders and anti-dilution protection also may be limited. 
 
(d) 
Although many of the emerging and less developed market securities in which the Fund 
invests are traded on securities exchanges, they may trade in limited volume and may 
encounter custody or settlement systems that are less well organised than those of 
developed markets. Thus there may be risks that settlement may be delayed and that 
cash or securities belonging to the Fund may be at risk because of defects in the 
systems or operations. There may also be a danger that competing claims may arise in 
respect of securities held by or to be transferred to the Fund and compensation schemes 
may be non-existent or limited to meet the Fund’s claims in any of these events. 
 
(e) 
Further risks may include: greater social, economic and political uncertainty, strong 
government involvement in the economy, less regulatory supervision, new and small 
companies exhibiting high volatility, and differences in auditing and reporting standards. 
 
(f) 
Investments in Russia are subject to certain heightened risks with regard to the 
ownership and custody of securities. In Russia this is evidenced by entries in the books 
of a company or its registrar (which is neither an agent nor responsible to the Depositary). 
No certificates representing ownership of Russian companies will be held by the 
Depositary or any of its local correspondents or in an effective central depository system. 
As a result of this system and the lack of the effective state regulation and enforcement, 
the Fund could lose its registration and ownership of Russian securities through fraud, 
negligence or even mere oversight. In addition, Russian securities have an increased 
custodial risk associated with them as such securities are, in accordance with market 
practice, held in custody with Russian institutions which may not have adequate 
insurance coverage to cover loss due to theft, destruction or default whilst such assets 
are in its custody.  
 
The Fund may invest a significant portion of its net assets in equities or transferable 
securities issued by companies domiciled, established or operating in Russia. 
Investments in transferable securities and Money Market Instruments which are not 
listed on stock exchanges or traded on a Regulated Market or on an Other Regulated 
Market in an EU Member State or other state, which include Russian transferable 
securities and Money Market Instruments may not exceed 10% of the assets of the 
relevant Fund. The Russian markets might indeed be exposed to liquidity risks, and 
liquidation of assets could therefore sometimes be lengthy or difficult. However, 
investments in transferable securities and Money Market Instruments which are listed 
or traded on the Russian Trading System and the Moscow Interbank Currency 
Exchange are not limited to 10% of the net asset of the Fund as such markets are 
 recognized as Regulated Markets. 
The Russian Trading System was established in 1995 to consolidate separate regional 
securities trading floors into a unified regulated Russian securities market. It lists in 
particular leading Russian securities. The Russian Trading System establishes market 
prices for a wide range of stocks and bonds. The trading information is distributed 
worldwide through financial information services companies, such as Reuters and 
 Bloomberg. 
The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange serves as a basis for the nationwide system 
of trading in the currency, stocks and derivatives sectors of the financial market, covering 
Moscow and Russia’s largest financial and industrial centres. Jointly with its partners 
the MICEX Group (the MICEX Stock Exchange, the MICEX Settlement House, the 
National Depositary Center, regional exchanges and other), the MICEX provides 
settlement and clearing as well as depositary services for about 1500 organisations and 
participants in the stock market.  

 <Page148>  
 
148 
 
 
(g) 
Investment in the Chinese market through Stock Connect is subject to the below 
 additional specific risks.  
 Liquidity and Volatility Risk 
The existence of a liquid trading market for China A-Shares may depend on whether 
there is supply of, and demand for, China A-Shares. The price at which securities may 
be purchased or sold by the Fund and the Net Asset Value of the Fund may be adversely 
affected if trading markets for China A-Shares are limited or absent. The China A-Share 
market may be more volatile and unstable (for example, due to the risk of suspension 
of a particular stock or government intervention). Market volatility and settlement 
difficulties in the China A-Share markets may also result in significant fluctuations in the 
prices of the securities traded on such markets and thereby may affect the value of the 
 Fund. 
 Suspension Risk  
It is contemplated that both SEHK and SSE/SZSE have the right to suspend or limit 
trading in any security traded on the relevant exchange if necessary for ensuring an 
orderly and fair market and that risks are managed prudently. In particular, trading band 
limits are imposed by the stock exchanges on China A-Shares, where trading in any 
China A-Share on the relevant stock exchange may be suspended if the trading price of 
the security has increased or decreased to the extent beyond the trading band limit. A 
suspension will render it impossible for the Fund to liquidate positions and could thereby 
expose the Fund to significant losses. Further, when the suspension is subsequently 
lifted, it may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate positions at a favourable price, 
which could thereby expose the Fund to significant losses. Finally, where a suspension 
 is effected, the Fund’s ability to access the PRC market will be adversely affected. 
 Quota and Other Limitations 
Although the Stock Connect is the first program allowing non-Chinese investors to trade 
the China A-Shares without a license and there is no longer an aggregate quota 
limitation, trading of China A-Shares through the Stock Connect is still subject to a daily 
quota (“Daily Quota”), which limits the maximum net buy value of cross-boundary trades 
under the Stock Connect each day. Northbound trading and Southbound trading under 
each of the Shanghai Stock Connect and the Shenzhen Stock Connect will be subject 
to a separate set of Daily Quota. The Northbound Daily Quota for each of the Shanghai 
Stock Connect and the Shenzhen Stock Connect is currently and respectively set at 
RMB52 billion. Quota limitations may prevent the Fund from purchasing the Stock 
Connect securities when it is otherwise advantageous to do so. In particular, once the 
remaining balance of the relevant Daily Quota drops to zero or the Daily Quota is 
exceeded, buy orders will be rejected (although investors will be permitted to sell their 
 cross-boundary securities regardless of the quota balance).  
 Differences in Business Day 
Because Stock Connect trades are routed through Hong Kong brokers and the SEHK, 
Stock Connect will only operate on days when both the PRC and Hong Kong markets 
are open for trading and when banks in both markets are open on the corresponding 
settlement days. Therefore, it is possible that there are occasions when it is a normal 
trading day for the PRC market but the Fund cannot carry out any China A-Shares 
trading via the Stock Connect. As a result, prices of the relevant China A-Shares may 
 fluctuate at times when the Fund is unable to add to or exit its position.  
Additionally, an investor cannot purchase and sell the same security on the same trading 
day on SSE/SZSE, which may restrict the Fund’s ability to invest in China A-Shares 

 <Page149>  
 
149 
 
through Stock Connect and to enter into or exit trades where it is advantageous to do 
 so on the same trading day.  
 Eligibility of Shares  
Only certain China A-Shares are eligible to be accessed through Stock Connect. Such 
securities may lose their eligibility at any time. When a China A-Share is recalled from 
the scope of eligible shares for trading via the Stock Connect, the China A-Share can 
only be sold but restricted from being bought. This may affect the investment portfolio 
or strategies of the Fund, for example, if the Fund wishes to purchase a China A-Share 
 which is recalled from the scope of eligible shares. 
 Operational Uncertainty  
Because Stock Connect is relatively new, its effects on the market for trading China A-
Shares are uncertain. In addition, the trading, settlement and IT systems required to 
operate Stock Connect are relatively new and continuing to evolve. In particular, the 
Stock Connect is premised on the functioning of the operational systems of the relevant 
market participants. Market participants are permitted to participate in this program 
subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk management and other 
requirements as may be specified by the relevant exchange and/or clearing house. The 
securities regimes and legal systems of the two markets differ significantly and market 
participants may need to address issues arising from the differences on an on-going 
basis. There is no assurance that the systems of the SEHK and market participants will 
function properly or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both 
markets. In the event that the relevant systems do not function properly, trading through 
Stock Connect could be disrupted and the relevant Fund’s ability to access the China 
A-Share market may be adversely affected and the Fund may not be able to effectively 
 pursue its investment strategy. 
 Other Legal and Regulation Risks 
Stock Connect is subject to regulation by both Hong Kong and China. The current 
regulations are untested and there is no certainty as to how they will be applied. In 
addition, the current regulations are subject to change and there can be no assurance 
that the Stock Connect will not be abolished. There can be no assurance that further 
regulations will not affect the availability of securities in the program, the frequency of 
redemptions or other limitations. Additional shareholder restrictions and disclosure 
requirements might also be applicable to the Fund as a result of their investments in 
 China A-Shares via Stock Connect.  
 Lack of Investor Protection  
Transactions through Stock Connect are not covered by the investor protection 
programs of either the Hong Kong or Shanghai/Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Investment 
in China A-Shares via the Stock Connect is conducted through brokers, and is subject 
to the risks of default by such brokers’ in their obligations. Investments of the Fund are 
not covered by the Hong Kong’s Investor Compensation Fund, which has been 
established to pay compensation to investors of any nationality who suffer pecuniary 
losses as a result of default of a licensed intermediary or authorised financial institution 
in relation to exchange-traded products in Hong Kong. Since default matters in respect 
of SSE/SZSE shares via Stock Connect do not involve products listed or traded in SEHK 
or Hong Kong Futures Exchange Limited, they will not be covered by the Investor 
Compensation Fund. Therefore the Fund is exposed to the risks of default of the 
broker(s) it engages in its trading in China A-Shares through the Stock Connect.

 Legal/Beneficial Ownership 
In China, Stock Connect securities are held on behalf of ultimate investors (such as the 
Fund) by the HKSCC as nominee. HKSCC in turn holds the SSE/SZSE shares, as the 
nominee holder, through an omnibus securities account in its name registered with 
ChinaClear. While Chinese regulators have affirmed that the ultimate investors hold a 
beneficial interest in Stock Connect securities, the law surrounding such rights is in its 
early stages and the mechanisms that beneficial owners may use to enforce their rights 
are untested and therefore pose uncertain risks. Further, courts in China have limited 
experience in applying the concept of beneficial ownership and the law surrounding 
beneficial ownership will continue to evolve as they do so. There is accordingly a risk 
that as the law is tested and developed, the Fund’s ability to enforce its ownership rights 
may be negatively impacted. Because of this uncertainty, in the unlikely event that 
HKSCC becomes subject to winding up proceedings in Hong Kong it is not clear if the 
SSE/SZSE shares will be regarded as held for the beneficial ownership of the Fund or 
as part of the general assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors. 
Furthermore, the Fund may not be able to participate in corporate actions affecting Stock 
Connect securities due to time constraints or for other operational reasons. Similarly, 
the Fund will not be able to vote in shareholders’ meetings except through HKSCC and 
 will not be able to attend shareholders’ meetings.  
 Clearing and Settlement Risk 
ChinaClear and HKSCC have established the clearing links and each becomes a 
participant of each other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-boundary trades. 
For cross-boundary trades initiated in a market, the clearing house of that market will on 
one hand clear and settle with its own clearing participants, and on the other hand 
undertake to fulfil the clearing and settlement obligations of its clearing participants with 
 the counterparty clearing house. 
As the national central counterparty of the PRC’s securities market, ChinaClear 
operates a comprehensive network of clearing, settlement and stock holding 
infrastructure. ChinaClear has established a risk management framework and measures 
that are approved and supervised by the CSRC. The chances of ChinaClear default are 
considered to be remote. In the remote event of a ChinaClear default, HKSCC’s liabilities 
in SSE/SZSE shares under its market contracts with clearing participants will be limited 
to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against ChinaClear. HKSCC 
should in good faith, seek recovery of the outstanding stocks and monies from 
ChinaClear through available legal channels or through ChinaClear’s liquidation. In that 
event, the Fund may suffer delay in the recovery process or may not fully recover its 
 losses from ChinaClear. 
 Pre-Trade Requirements and Special Segregated Accounts  
PRC regulations require that before an investor sells any share, there should be 
sufficient shares in the account; otherwise SSE/SZSE will reject the sell order concerned. 
SEHK will carry out pre-trade checking on China A-Share sell orders of its participants 
 (i.e. the stock brokers) to ensure there is no over-selling. 
If the Fund intends to sell certain China A-Shares it holds, it must transfer those China 
A-Shares to the respective accounts of its broker(s) before the market opens on the day 
of selling. If it fails to meet this deadline, it will not be able to sell those shares on the 
trading day. Because of this requirement, the Fund may not be able to dispose of its 
 holdings of China A-Shares in a timely manner. 
In addition, as the broker(s) of the Fund will hold and safe-keep the Chinese A-Shares 
before the trading day, there is a risk that the creditors of the broker(s) will seek to assert 

 <Page151>  
 
151 
 
that the Chinese A-Shares are owned by the brokers rather than the Fund if it is not 
made clear that the broker(s) act as a custodian in respect of the Chinese A-Shares for 
 the benefit of the Fund. 
Alternatively, if the Fund maintains its SSE/SZSE shares with a custodian which is a 
custodian participant or general clearing participant participating in the Hong Kong 
Central Clearing and Settlement System (“CCASS”), the Fund may request such 
custodian to open a special segregated account (“SPSA”) in CCASS to maintain its 
holdings in SSE/SZSE shares under the enhanced pre-trade checking model. Each 
SPSA will be assigned a unique “Investor ID” by CCASS for the purpose of facilitating 
the Stock Connect system to verify the holdings of an investor such as the Fund. 
Provided that there is sufficient holding in the SPSA when a broker inputs the relevant 
Fund’s sell order, the Fund will only need to transfer SSE/SZSE shares from its SPSA 
to its broker’s account after execution and not before placing the sell order and the Fund 
will not be subject to the risk of being unable to dispose of its holdings of China A-Shares 
in a timely manner due to failure to transfer of China A-Shares to its brokers in a timely 
 manner. 
In addition, these pre-trade requirements may, as a practical matter, limit the number of 
brokers that the Fund may use to execute trades. In relation to transactions executing 
through a SPSA order, the Fund, as the investor, may at most designate 20 brokers 
currently. While the Fund may use SPSA in lieu of the pre-trade check, many market 
participants have yet to fully implement IT systems necessary to complete trades 
involving securities in such accounts in a timely manner. Market practice as well as 
governmental policies with respect to SPSA is continuing to evolve. 
 
FDI Risks 
 
(a) 
Certain types of assets such as FDIs may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market 
conditions, and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(b) 
The OTC derivative transactions may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon 
the occurrence of certain events with respect to either an Approved Counterparty or the 
Fund (for example failure to pay, insolvency or the imposition of withholding tax on the 
payments due by either party). Upon termination of a Derivative Contract, the Fund or 
the relevant Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment 
(regardless of which party may have caused such termination) based on the marked to 
market value of such Derivative Contract at such time, as determined in accordance 
with the terms of such Derivative Contract. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may gain exposure to some or all of the constituents of the Portfolio via FDIs. 
Shareholders will not have direct ownership rights (including, without limitation, voting 
rights) with respect to such constituents of the Portfolio if FDIs are used. If the Fund has 
any ownership rights (including, without limitation, voting rights) with respect to the 
constituents of the Portfolio, the Fund may exercise such rights at its sole discretion 
without taking into account the request of any investor. 
 
(d) 
The return payable under FDIs with an Approved Counterparty is subject to the credit 
risk of such Approved Counterparty. In the event that the risk exposure to an Approved 
Counterparty in such FDI exceeds the limits prescribed by the Authority, such Approved 
Counterparty is required to provide collateral to the Fund such that the risk exposure to 
such Approved Counterparty is limited in accordance with the Law and applicable 
regulations. On the bankruptcy or insolvency of an Approved Counterparty, the Fund 
may experience delays in liquidating the positions taken and may incur significant losses, 
including declines in the value of its investment or the collateral posted by such 
Approved Counterparty during the period in which the Fund seeks to enforce its rights, 
inability to realise any gains on its investment or the collateral during such period and 
fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. 

 <Page152>  
 
152 
 
 
(e) 
An Approved Counterparty is likely to act as Calculation Agent under a Derivative 
Contract. In such circumstances Shareholders should note that there may be potential 
conflicts of interest in the performance of the function of Calculation Agent by such entity. 
In circumstances, where an Approved Counterparty acts as Calculation Agent, such 
Approved Counterparty will use its reasonable endeavours to resolve any such conflicts 
of interest fairly (having regard to its respective obligations and duties) and to ensure 
that the interests of the Company and the Shareholders are not unfairly prejudiced. In 
addition, and to the extent that Barclays Bank PLC acts as an Approved Counterparty 
and Calculation Agent, the operational risks arising from any such potential lack of 
independence are in part reduced by the fact that different divisions within Barclays 
Bank PLC will be responsible for the different roles. 
 
 CIS and ETF Risks 
(a) 
Each CIS or ETF that forms part of the Portfolio may have a different settlement cycle 
than that of the Fund. Thus, there may be a mismatch between such settlement cycles 
causing the Company, on behalf of the Fund, to use borrowing on a temporary basis to 
meet such obligations, subject to the available limits. This may result in charges being 
incurred by the Fund. Any such borrowing will comply with the UCITS guidelines. 
Further, each CIS may not be valued at the same time or on the same day as the Fund 
and accordingly, the net asset value of each CIS used in the calculation of the Net Asset 
Value of the Fund will be the latest available net asset value of such CIS as at the 
Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day or the probable realisation value as 
estimated in good faith by the Administrator (further details on the calculation of Net 
Asset Value of the Fund are set out in the Prospectus under “Share Dealings – 
Calculation of Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets”). 
 
(b) 
The investment decisions of any underlying CIS or ETFs which the Fund may invest in, 
are made by their own investment managers or advisors; such investment decisions 
are independent from the Investment Manager’s investment decisions for the Fund. The 
Investment Manager does not take responsibility for the investment decisions made by 
the investment managers or advisors of any underlying CIS or ETFs. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may invest in CIS or ETFs which use leverage or other forms of financial 
derivatives, such as futures and options. As such, investment in the Fund may be more 
volatile than investment in other funds. 
 
(d) 
The underlying CIS or ETFs investing in swap(s) and/or financial derivative instruments 
will be exposed to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty trading with 
the relevant underlying CIS or ETF will be unable to meet its obligation to make 
payments or to settle a trade. Moreover, should a counterparty become bankrupt or 
insolvent, such underlying CIS or ETF may incur significant losses, including declines 
in the value of its investment during the period in which the relevant underlying CIS or 
ETF seeks to enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment during 
such period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. There is also a 
possibility that the above transactions may be terminated due to certain events, such 
as bankruptcy, supervening illegality or change in the tax or accounting laws relative to 
those in force at the time the transactions were entered into. 
 
Currency Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s foreign currency exposure is not expected to be hedged. Investors should 
note that some or all of the constituents of the Portfolio may be denominated in 
currencies different from the Base Currency of the Fund and as such, the Portfolio will 
be exposed to the fluctuation in exchange rates which may adversely affect the value 
of the Shares. Exchange rates between currencies are determined by a number of 
factors including (but not limited to) the supply and demand in the international 

 <Page153>  
 
153 
 
currency markets, which are influenced by macro economic factors (such as the 
economic development in the different currency areas, interest rates and international 
capital movements), speculation and central bank and government policies (including 
the imposition of currency controls and restrictions). Investors should also note that 
their investment may be exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates if the Base Currency 
of the Fund and/or the currency in which the investment(s) of the Fund is denominated 
 in is different from the currency in which they subscribe for Shares in the Fund. 
(b) 
With respect to any of the constituents of the Portfolio, the occurrence or official 
declaration of an event impacting one or more currencies of denomination of the 
constituents of the Portfolio, which the Investment Manager determines, in its sole and 
absolute discretion, would materially disrupt or impair its ability to meet its obligations 
or otherwise settle, clear or hedge any of its positions, will be deemed a “Currency 
Disruption Event”. In the event of such Currency Disruption Event, the Fund may be 
disrupted. This disruption may lead to a possible termination of the Fund and 
Shareholders will therefore receive the net proceeds of the assets of the Fund. 
 
 Taxation Risks 
Taxation of interest and capital gains in relation to investments in Emerging Market 
Equities may be comparatively high. Furthermore, the local taxation of such investments 
may not always be offset under a tax treaty between the relevant Emerging Market tax 
jurisdiction and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, where the Company is domiciled. 
There may be less well-defined tax laws in Emerging Markets and they may permit 
retroactive taxation so that the Fund could become subject to local tax liabilities that had 
not been anticipated in conducting investment activities or valuing assets. The Fund 
may also incur additional costs, such as reporting costs, in relation to local taxation. 
 
Other Risks 
 
(a) 
Any Repo Transaction may be terminated in accordance with its terms upon the 
occurrence of certain events with respect to either the Repo Counterparty or the Fund 
(including failure to pay or insolvency or breach of agreement). Upon such termination, 
the default market value of the securities which are the subject of the Repo Transaction 
will be determined in accordance with the terms of the relevant Repo Transaction and 
a payment settling each party's claim against the other under such Repo Transaction 
will, based on such determination, be made by either the Repo Counterparty or the 
Fund. From this point on (1) the Fund will retain ownership of such securities and 
therefore will be exposed to the market risk and credit risk of these securities and (2) 
there is no further obligation on the Repo Counterparty to repurchase equivalent 
securities and/or to deliver to the Fund additional equivalent securities if the market 
value of the securities decreases.  
 
(b) 
If a Disruption Event occurs, the Directors may make such determinations and/or 
adjustments to the terms of the Portfolio as considered appropriate to determine the 
value of any Fund Asset. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment. If 
a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Administrator is unable to calculate the Net 
Asset Value of the Fund, the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the 
Net Asset Value until the day the Administrator is able to calculate the Net Asset Value 
of the Fund. The Directors may also make adjustments to determine the value of the 
Fund Assets; temporarily suspend the calculation of Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, redemption or exchange of Shares; and/or terminate the Fund, in each 
case, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles.

 any Fund Asset, and if, in the sole discretion of the Investment Manager, such event is material: 
(i) 
it is not possible to obtain a price or value (or an element of such price or value) of any 
Fund Asset according to the rules or normal accepted procedures for the determination

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The Investment Objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with enhanced capital growth over 
the long term with a medium to high level of risk. The Fund will invest in a wide range of global 
asset classes as more fully described in the section “General Description of the Underlying” below. 
The allocation between individual assets is determined semi-annually based on the Allocation 
Strategy. This strategy uses economic data and analysis of asset prices to generate allocation 
recommendations which will be implemented by the Investment Manager, based on the investment 
advice provided periodically by the Investment Advisor, and is more fully described in the section 
 “General Description of the Underlying”.  
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the Investment Objective. The Fund is 
 neither capital protected nor guaranteed.  
 Investment Policy 
In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund may invest in Transferable Securities, 
Money Market Instruments (including deposits), FDIs, open-ended exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) 
and collective investment schemes (“CIS”), although it is intended that the Fund will mainly invest 
 in such asset classes indirectly through investment funds. 
 The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. 
 General Description of the Underlying 
(A) 
Underlying 
 
In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund will invest in a wide range of global asset 
classes including but not limited to shares (including Norwegian shares and emerging market 
shares), fixed income (rates instruments and bonds issued by corporate bodies and governments, 
including Norwegian corporate and government bonds), foreign exchange, commodity-linked 
instruments (qualified as eligible transferable securities according to the article 41(1) of the Law 
and the Grand Ducal regulation of 8 February 2008) and infrastructure-related securities, share 
volatility instruments and money market instruments. The Fund will mainly invest in these asset 
classes indirectly through investment funds (including open-ended exchange-traded funds 
 (“ETF”)). 
The composition of the Fund is rebalanced by the Investment Manager on each Semi-Annual 
Rebalancing Date in accordance with the Allocation Strategy, whereby a long position may be 
 taken in any of the eligible assets and instruments, subject to any regulatory limitations.  
The Investment Manager may also add or remove eligible assets and instruments in its sole 
         discretion, but at all times in accordance with the Law and any regulatory limitations. 

 <Page161>  
 
161 
 
(B) 
Allocation Strategy 
 
The Investment Advisor shall provide advice to the Investment Manager in accordance with an 
investment advisory agreement entered into between the Investment Manager and the Investment 
Advisor. The advice may comprise the asset classes, assets and exposures within the limits set 
out below unless otherwise agreed by the Investment Manager, all as may be amended and agreed 
 in writing between the Investment Advisor and the Investment Manager from time to time.

The Allocation Strategy combines analysis of economic data and investment research with a 
discretionary oversight and is used to generate the target allocation to the Fund’s assets or 
 constituents on each Semi-Annual Allocation Date for the following six-month investment horizon.  
 The Allocation Strategy broadly comprises the following steps: 
(i) 
strategy allocation (i.e. an allocation decision between the main asset classes); 
(ii) 
global diversification (including international assets to diversify Norwegian exposures); 
(iii) 
on-going monitoring of the portfolio. 
 
 The fund composition will be notified to Shareholders in ongoing monthly reporting. 
Where the Fund gains exposures to Norwegian shares and bonds, it is intended that the Fund will 
mainly invest in investment funds managed by Pareto Nordic Investments AS and Pareto 
Forvaltning AS, which form part of the same group of companies as the Investment Advisor. 
Additionally, the Fund may invest in investment funds which are managed by the Investment 
 Manager or an affiliated entity. 
(C) 
Rebalancing 
 
Under normal market conditions, the composition of the Fund is rebalanced on each Semi-Annual 
 Rebalancing Date, provided that: 
(i) 
the Investment Manager may choose to accept or reject the advice received from the 
Investment Advisor and instead determine the composition of the Fund and the respective 
allocations to any constituents in its sole discretion in order to achieve the Investment 
Objective of the Fund; and 
 
(ii) 
the Investment Manager in its sole discretion where deemed appropriate in order to 
achieve the Investment Objective, may, from time to time between successive Semi-
Annual Rebalancing Dates, modify the composition of the Fund, including putting in place 
hedging arrangements with respect to some or all of the constituents, or even reducing the 
allocation to zero. Where the exposure to some or all constituents is reduced to zero, the 
Fund will invest the balance in Money Market Instruments and fixed income securities in 
the form of short-dated sovereign bonds. The Fund will subsequently reinvest in the 
constituents selected in accordance with the Allocation Strategy, either on the immediately 
following Semi-Annual Rebalancing Date or earlier, as determined by the Investment 
Manager.

 Investment Restrictions 
 The general Investment Restrictions set out in the Prospectus apply to this Fund. 
The Fund will not invest more than 20% of its assets in asset-backed securities and mortgage 
 backed securities. 
 Global Exposure 
In accordance with the Law and applicable regulations, the Fund's global exposure through the use 
of FDIs will not exceed the total value of the Fund’s net assets in accordance with the commitment 
 approach. 
 Valuation 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day in order to determine 
 the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out in the Prospectus. 
 Use of FDIs  
The Fund may gain exposure to the Underlying through FDIs (including futures, forwards, Options 
and/or swaps). They may also be used for efficient portfolio management purposes, as further 
detailed under “Currency Hedging”, and used to hedge the exposure of the Fund to interest rates, 
 equities, currencies and other risks. 
Each Approved Counterparty to the FDI will be required to provide collateral to the Company so 
that the Company's risk exposure to the relevant Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent 
required by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
 Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs will have a fixed maturity and may also be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events 
with respect to either the Fund or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event 
of default (such as a failure to pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event 
(which is not the fault of either party, for example, illegality or a tax event) or a Disruption Event. In 
each case the FDI will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter 
into new FDIs with other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the financial asset 
 classes. 
The Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with the Authority. 
The Fund will only invest in FDIs in accordance with this risk management policy. The 
Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to Shareholders relating to 
the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative limits that are applied 
and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of the main categories of 
 investments. 
 Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that the Fund does not use TRS. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 

 <Page163>  
 
163 
 
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
will be paid in cash or made in specie in compliance with the Articles. If a Shareholder that is 
requesting redemption of Shares consents, the Company will have the right to satisfy payment of 
the Repurchase Price by allocating assets from the Fund to such Shareholder which are equal in 
value to the value of the Shares being redeemed. The nature and type of such assets shall be 
determined on both a pro rata basis and on a fair and reasonable basis, with due regard to all 
applicable laws and regulations and will take into account the interests of the remaining 
Shareholders. The valuation used shall be confirmed by a report of the Company's auditor. The 
 costs of any such redemption in specie shall be borne by the redeeming Shareholder. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; (c) dealing charges, taxes and 
other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and (d) payments 
 of any dividend. 
The Subscription Price or Repurchase Price may be adjusted respectively in accordance with the 
Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no subscription or redemption in 
the Fund or a specific Share Class on the relevant Dealing Day, the Subscription Price or the 
Repurchase Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share Class rounded downwards to 
 such number of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
The following table gives an example of the effect that holding of cash in the Fund has on the 
percentage performance of the Fund Assets when translated into the Net Asset Value per Share. 
The figures included in the following table are purely illustrative and should not be 
understood as indicators of potential performance of the Fund.

The example shown in the table assumes that the Fund holds only Fund assets and ancillary cash 
and is collateralised to the extent required by the Law and applicable regulations. It also assumes 
a constant investment with no additional subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without 
       deduction of any fees or expenses.

 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good 
faith, make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets. The Net 
 Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 
(ii) 
the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and 
any subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the 
provisions of the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net 
Asset Value”; and/or 
 
(iii) 
the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in 
the Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will solely be entitled to look to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and an Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds in 
payment of all claims of an Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if 
any) of the Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the 
Fund, such claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be 
automatically extinguished, (b) an Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in 
respect thereof and (c) an Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of 
 the Company as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowing 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. The Fund will not borrow for investment 
 purposes. 
 Dividend Policy 
 There are no dividend entitlements in respect of any Share Classes.

1 The Management Fee, which represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant 
Share Class (plus VAT, if any) is subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1.250 EUR per Fund. 
The Management Fee is payable by the Company out of the Fund to the Management Company. 
The Management Fee will accrue daily and be calculated on each Dealing Day. The fees of the 
Investment Manager, Investment Advisor, Distributor, Sub-Distributor or any third party will be 
payable out of the Management Fee and not out of the assets of the Fund. Neither the Management 
Company, the Investment Manager, the Investment Advisor, the Distributor, the Sub Distributor or 
any third party will be entitled to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their respective 
 out-of-pocket expenses. 
2 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share Class is payable by the Company for 
the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Fees of the Management Company, 
Extraordinary Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. 
Additionally, the Fixed Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg as disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of 
 doubt, please note that Transaction Fees (as defined below) are excluded from Fixed Fees. 
 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees means certain costs which may be incurred in respect of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, any fees charged by an Approved Counterparty to an FDI, collateral 
costs that may be charged in relation to FDIs, brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads 
and licensing fees. The Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund will be calculated net of such costs, 
 which may affect the performance of the Fund.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
Certain risks relating to the Shares are set out under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus. 
 In addition, Shareholders should note that: 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE 
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
 ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND IS TO PROVIDE THE INVESTORS WITH A 
 RETURN LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING. 
General Risks related to Investment in the Fund 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that any 
dividends will be paid. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
The Fund is a sub-fund of the Company. The sub-funds of the Company are segregated 
as a matter of Luxembourg law and as such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund 
will not be available to satisfy the liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be 
noted that the Company is a single legal entity which may operate or have assets held 
on its behalf or be subject to claims in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily 
recognise such segregation. There can be no guarantee that the courts of any 
jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
Market Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s performance is related to the performance of the Fund Assets. The Fund 
is therefore exposed to general market movements and trends in money market, 
equities, emerging markets equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and 
volatility, which are occasionally partially affected by irrational factors. Such factors 
may lead to a more significant and longer lasting decline in prices affecting the entire 
market. 
 
Strategy and Investment Risks 
 
(a) 
The Allocation Strategy employed by the Investment Manager, based on the advice of 
the Investment Advisor, aims to generate an optimal allocation to the constituents, as 
described in the section “General Description of the Underlying – Allocation Strategy”. 
There is, however, no assurance that the strategy will succeed, and consequently, the 
Fund may fail to achieve its Investment Objective. 
 

 <Page168>  
 
168 
 
(b) 
The Investment Manager retains certain discretion in respect of the application of 
Allocation Strategy to determine the composition of the Fund, as disclosed in the 
section “General Description of the Underlying – Allocation Strategy”. While such 
discretion will be exercised by the Investment Manager with a view to achieve the 
Investment Objective of the Fund, there is no assurance that the Investment Objective 
will always be achieved. 
 
(c) 
The Fund will be subject to certain costs, including transaction costs (which may 
include, without limitation, a buy-sell spread) when investing in certain constituents, as 
disclosed in the section on “Transaction Fees”. Such fees or costs will affect the Net 
Asset Value per Share of the Fund. 
 
FDI Risks 
 
(a) 
Certain types of assets such as FDIs may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market 
conditions, and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(b) 
The OTC derivative transactions may be terminated in accordance with their terms 
upon the occurrence of certain events with respect to either an Approved Counterparty 
or the Fund (for example failure to pay, insolvency or the imposition of withholding tax 
on the payments due by either party). Upon termination of a FDI, the Fund or the 
relevant Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment 
(regardless of which party may have caused such termination) based on the marked 
to market value of such FDI at such time, as determined in accordance with the terms 
of such FDI. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may gain exposure to some or all of the constituents via FDIs. Shareholders 
will not have direct ownership rights (including, without limitation, voting rights) with 
respect to such constituents if FDIs are used. If the Fund has any ownership rights 
(including, without limitation, voting rights) with respect to the constituents, the Fund 
may exercise such rights at its sole discretion without taking into account the request 
of any investor. 
 
(d) 
The return payable under FDIs with an Approved Counterparty is subject to the credit 
risk of such Approved Counterparty. In the event that the risk exposure to an Approved 
Counterparty in such a FDI exceeds the limits prescribed by the Authority, such 
Approved Counterparty is required to provide collateral to the Fund such that the risk 
exposure to such Approved Counterparty is limited in accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations. On the bankruptcy or insolvency of an Approved Counterparty, 
the Fund may experience delays in liquidating the positions taken and may incur 
significant losses, including declines in the value of its investment or the collateral 
posted by such Approved Counterparty during the period in which the Fund seeks to 
enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment or the collateral during 
such period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. 
 
(e) 
An Approved Counterparty is likely to act as Calculation Agent under a FDI. In such 
circumstances Shareholders should note that there may be potential conflicts of 
interest in the performance of the function of Calculation Agent by such entity. In 
circumstances, where an Approved Counterparty acts as Calculation Agent, such 
Approved Counterparty will use its reasonable endeavours to resolve any such 
conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to its respective obligations and duties) and to 
ensure that the interests of the Company and the Shareholders are not unfairly 
prejudiced. In addition, and to the extent that Barclays Bank PLC acts as an Approved 
Counterparty and Calculation Agent, the operational risks arising from any such 
potential lack of independence are in part reduced by the fact that different divisions 
within Barclays Bank PLC will be responsible for the different roles. 
  

 <Page169>  
 
169 
 
CIS and ETF Risks 
 
(a) 
Each CIS or ETF in which the Fund invests may have a different settlement cycle than 
that of the Fund. Thus, there may be mismatch between the two settlement cycles 
causing the Company, on behalf of the Fund, to use borrowing on a temporary basis 
to meet such obligations, subject to the available limits. This may result in charges 
being incurred by the Fund. Any such borrowing will comply with the UCITS guidelines. 
Further, each CIS may not be valued at the same time or on the same day as the Fund 
and accordingly, the net asset value of each CIS used in the calculation of the Net 
Asset Value of the Fund will be the latest available net asset value of such CIS as at 
the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day or the probable realisation value as 
estimated in good faith by the Administrator (further details on the calculation of Net 
Asset Value of the Fund are set out in the Prospectus under “Share Dealings – 
Calculation of Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets”). 
 
(b) 
The investment decisions of the underlying CIS or ETFs which the Fund may invest in, 
are made by their investment managers or advisors; such investment decisions are 
independent from the Investment Manager’s investment decisions for the Fund. The 
Investment Manager does not take responsibility for the investment decisions made by 
the investment managers or advisor of these underlying CIS or ETFs. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may invest in CIS or ETFs which use leverage or other forms of financial 
derivatives, such as futures and options. As such, investment in the Fund may be more 
volatile than investment in other funds. 
 
(d) 
The underlying CIS or ETFs investing in swap(s) and/or financial derivative instruments 
will be exposed to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty trading with 
the relevant underlying CIS or ETF will be unable to meet its obligation to make 
payments or to settle a trade. Moreover, should a counterparty become bankrupt or 
insolvent, such underlying CIS or ETF may incur significant losses, including declines 
in the value of its investment during the period in which the relevant underlying CIS or 
ETF seeks to enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment during 
such period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. There is also a 
possibility that the above transactions may be terminated due to certain events, such 
as bankruptcy, supervening illegality or change in the tax or accounting laws relative 
 to those in force at the time the transactions were entered into. 
(e) 
The Fund may invest in CIS and/or ETFs eligible for UCITS whose net asset value is 
calculated by the same entity in charge of the asset management (i.e. their 
management company), which may involve a greater risk of administrative error and/or 
conflict of interest due to potentially differing degrees of segregation with respect to the 
management duties and the pricing of the portfolio in the business model employed by 
such CIS and/or ETFs as compared with a CIS or ETF that is externally administered. 
 
Risks related to investment in Emerging Markets 
 
(a) 
The Fund may invest in emerging markets debt securities, equities or currencies 
directly or via CIS, ETFs, FDIs. Investment in emerging markets may increase the 
volatility of the Fund’s Net Asset Value. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund’s 
Shares may be worth more or less on redemption than their original purchase value. 
Investing in emerging markets involves additional risks and special considerations not 
typically associated with investing in other more established economies or securities 
markets. Such risks may include (1) restrictions on foreign investment and on 
repatriation of capital invested in emerging markets, (2) currency fluctuations, (3) 
potential price volatility and lesser liquidity of securities traded in emerging markets, 
(4) economic and political risks, including the risk of nationalization or expropriation of 
assets or confiscatory taxation, (5) risks related to custodial arrangements and delays 
or other factors in the settlement of securities transactions, and (6) accounting, 

 <Page170>  
 
170 
 
auditing, financial and other reporting standards in emerging markets are not 
equivalent to those in more developed markets. Many of the laws that govern private 
investment, securities transactions and other contractual relationships in emerging 
countries are new and largely untested. As a result, the Fund may be subject to a 
number of unusual risks, including inadequate investor protection, contradictory 
legislation, incomplete, unclear and changing laws, ignorance or breaches of 
regulations on the part of other market participants, lack of established or effective 
avenues for legal redress, lack of standard practices and confidentiality customs 
characteristic of developed markets and lack of enforcement of existing regulations. 
Furthermore, it may be difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment in certain of the 
emerging countries in which assets of the Fund are invested. There can be no 
assurance that this difficulty in protecting and enforcing rights will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Fund and its operations. Regulatory controls and corporate 
governance of companies in emerging countries confer little protection on minority 
shareholders. Anti-fraud and anti-insider trading legislation is often rudimentary. The 
concept of fiduciary duty to shareholders by officers and directors is also limited when 
compared to such concepts in developed markets. In certain instances management 
may take significant actions without the consent of shareholders and anti-dilution 
protection also may be limited. 
 
Currency Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s foreign currency exposure may be hedged at the Investment Manager’s 
discretion, fully, partially or not at all. Investors should note that some or all of the 
constituents may be denominated in currencies different from the Base Currency of 
the Fund and as such, the Fund will be exposed to the fluctuation in exchange rates 
which may adversely affect the value of the Shares. Exchange rates between 
currencies are determined by a number of factors including (but not limited to) the 
supply and demand in the international currency markets, which are influenced by 
macro economic factors (such as the economic development in the different currency 
areas, interest rates and international capital movements), speculation and central 
bank and government policies (including the imposition of currency controls and 
restrictions). Investors should also note that their investment may be exposed to 
fluctuations in exchange rates if the Base Currency of the Fund and/or the currency in 
which the investment(s) of the Fund is denominated in is different from the currency in 
which they subscribe for Shares in the Fund. 
 
(b) 
With respect to currency hedging, hedging against a decline in the value of the Fund’s 
positions does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of the positions of the relevant 
Share Class or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline as a result of 
movements in currency exchange rates, but establishes other positions designed to 
gain from those same developments, thus offsetting the decline in the value of the 
Fund’s positions. Such hedging transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if the 
value of the Fund’s positions should increase. It may not be possible for the Fund to 
hedge against a change or event at a price sufficient to protect its assets from the 
decline in value of the positions of the relevant Share Class anticipated as a result of 
such change. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge against certain changes or 
events at all, or the Investment Manager may choose not to hedge all or any of the 
Fund’s exposure or may choose to execute the hedge for only certain Share Classes. 
 
Other Risks 
 
(a) 
If a Disruption Event occurs, the Directors may make such determinations and/or 
adjustments to the terms of the Fund as considered appropriate to determine the value 
of any Fund Asset. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment. If a Market 
Disruption Event occurs and the Administrator is unable to calculate the Net Asset Value 
of the Fund, the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset 
Value until the day the Administrator is able to calculate the Net Asset Value of the Fund. 

 <Page171>  
 
171 
 
The Directors may also make adjustments to determine the value of the Fund Assets; 
temporarily suspend the calculation of Net Asset Value and any subscription, 
redemption or exchange of Shares; and/or terminate the Fund, in each case, in 
accordance with the provisions of the Articles.

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The Investment Objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with moderate capital growth over 
the long term with a medium level of risk. The Fund will invest in a wide range of global asset 
classes as more fully described in the section “General Description of the Underlying” below. The 
allocation between individual assets is determined semi-annually based on the Allocation Strategy. 
This strategy uses economic data and analysis of asset prices to generate allocation 
recommendations which will be implemented by the Investment Manager, based on the investment 
advice provided periodically by the Investment Advisor, and is more fully described in the section 
 “General Description of the Underlying”.  
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the Investment Objective. The Fund is 
 neither capital protected nor guaranteed.  
 Investment Policy 
In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund may invest in Transferable Securities, 
Money Market Instruments (including deposits), FDIs, open-ended exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) 
and collective investment schemes (“CIS”), although it is intended that the Fund will mainly invest 
 in such asset classes indirectly through investment funds. 
 The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. 
 General Description of the Underlying 
(A) 
Underlying 
 
In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund will invest in a wide range of global asset 
classes including but not limited to shares (including Norwegian shares and emerging market 
shares), fixed income (rates instruments and bonds issued by corporate bodies and governments, 
including Norwegian corporate and government bonds), foreign exchange, commodity-linked 
instruments (qualified as eligible transferable securities according to the article 41(1) of the Law 
and the Grand Ducal regulation of 8 February 2008) and infrastructure-related securities, share 
volatility instruments and money market instruments. The Fund will mainly invest in these asset 
classes indirectly through investment funds (including open-ended exchange-traded funds 
 (“ETF”)). 
The composition of the Fund is rebalanced by the Investment Manager on each Semi-Annual 
Rebalancing Date in accordance with the Allocation Strategy, whereby a long position may be 
 taken in any of the eligible assets and instruments, subject to any regulatory limitations.  
The Investment Manager may also add or remove eligible assets and instruments in its sole 
         discretion, but at all times in accordance with the Law and any regulatory limitations. 

 <Page178>  
 
178 
 
(B) 
Allocation Strategy 
 
The Investment Advisor shall provide advice to the Investment Manager in accordance with an 
investment advisory agreement entered into between the Investment Manager and the Investment 
Advisor. The advice may comprise the asset classes, assets and exposures within the limits set 
out below unless otherwise agreed by the Investment Manager, all as may be amended and agreed 
 in writing between the Investment Advisor and the Investment Manager from time to time.  
Asset class 
Minimum allocation 
Maximum allocation 
Equities (total)

Fixed income (total) 
30% 
70% 
Alternative assets 
0%

The Allocation Strategy combines analysis of economic data and investment research with a 
discretionary oversight and is used to generate the target allocation to the Fund’s assets or 
 constituents on each Semi-Annual Allocation Date for the following six-month investment horizon.  
The Allocation Strategy broadly comprises the following steps: 
(i) 
strategy allocation (i.e. an allocation decision between the main asset classes); 
(ii) 
global diversification (including international assets to diversify Norwegian exposures); 
(iii) 
on-going monitoring of the portfolio. 
 
 The fund composition will be notified to Shareholders in ongoing monthly reporting. 
Where the Fund gains exposures to Norwegian shares and bonds, it is intended that the Fund will 
mainly invest in investment funds managed by Pareto Nordic Investments AS and Pareto 
Forvaltning AS, which form part of the same group of companies as the Investment Advisor. 
Additionally, the Fund may invest in investment funds which are managed by the Investment 
 Manager or an affiliated entity. 
(C) 
Rebalancing 
 
Under normal market conditions, the composition of the Fund is rebalanced on each Semi-Annual 
Rebalancing Date, provided that: 
(i) 
the Investment Manager may choose to accept or reject the advice received from the 
Investment Advisor and instead determine the composition of the Fund and the respective 
allocations to any constituents in its sole discretion in order to achieve the Investment 
Objective of the Fund; and 
(ii) 
the Investment Manager in its sole discretion where deemed appropriate in order to 
achieve the Investment Objective, may, from time to time between successive Semi-
Annual Rebalancing Dates, modify the composition of the Fund, including putting in place 
hedging arrangements with respect to some or all of the constituents, or even reducing the 
allocation to zero. Where the exposure to some or all constituents is reduced to zero, the 
Fund will invest the balance in Money Market Instruments and fixed income securities in 
the form of short-dated sovereign bonds. The Fund will subsequently reinvest in the 
constituents selected in accordance with the Allocation Strategy, either on the immediately 
following Semi-Annual Rebalancing Date or earlier, as determined by the Investment 
Manager.  
      

 <Page179>  
 
179 
 
 Investment Restrictions 
 The general Investment Restrictions set out in the Prospectus apply to this Fund. 
The Fund will not invest more than 20% of its assets in asset-backed securities and mortgage 
 backed securities. 
 Global Exposure 
In accordance with the Law and applicable regulations, the Fund's global exposure through the use 
of FDIs will not exceed the total value of the Fund’s net assets in accordance with the commitment 
 approach. 
 Valuation 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day in order to determine 
 the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out in the Prospectus. 
 Use of FDIs  
The Fund may gain exposure to the Underlying through FDIs (including futures, forwards, Options 
and/or swaps). They may also be used for efficient portfolio management purposes, as further 
detailed under “Currency Hedging”, and used to hedge the exposure of the Fund to interest rates, 
 equities, currencies and other risks. 
Each Approved Counterparty to the FDI will be required to provide collateral to the Company so 
that the Company's risk exposure to the relevant Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent 
required by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs will have a fixed maturity and may also be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events 
with respect to either the Fund or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event 
of default (such as a failure to pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event 
(which is not the fault of either party, for example, illegality or a tax event) or a Disruption Event. In 
each case the FDI will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter 
into new FDIs with other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the financial asset 
 classes. 
The Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with the Authority. 
The Fund will only invest in FDIs in accordance with this risk management policy. The 
Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to Shareholders relating to 
the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative limits that are applied 
and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of the main categories of 
 investments. 
 Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that the Fund does not use TRS. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 

 <Page180>  
 
180 
 
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
will be paid in cash or made in specie in compliance with the Articles. If a Shareholder that is 
requesting redemption of Shares consents, the Company will have the right to satisfy payment of 
the Repurchase Price by allocating assets from the Fund to such Shareholder which are equal in 
value to the value of the Shares being redeemed. The nature and type of such assets shall be 
determined on both a pro rata basis and on a fair and reasonable basis, with due regard to all 
applicable laws and regulations and will take into account the interests of the remaining 
Shareholders. The valuation used shall be confirmed by a report of the Company's auditor. The 
 costs of any such redemption in specie shall be borne by the redeeming Shareholder. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; (c) dealing charges, taxes and 
other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and (d) payments 
 of any dividend. 
The Subscription Price or Repurchase Price may be adjusted respectively in accordance with the 
Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no subscription or redemption in 
the Fund or a specific Share Class on the relevant Dealing Day, the Subscription Price or the 
Repurchase Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share Class rounded downwards to 
 such number of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
The following table gives an example of the effect that holding of cash in the Fund has on the 
percentage performance of the Fund Assets when translated into the Net Asset Value per Share. 
The figures included in the following table are purely illustrative and should not be 
understood as indicators of potential performance of the Fund.

The example shown in the table assumes that the Fund holds only Fund assets and ancillary cash 
and is collateralised to the extent required by the Law and applicable regulations. It also assumes 
a constant investment with no additional subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without 
       deduction of any fees or expenses. 

 <Page181>  
 
181 
 
 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good faith, 
make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets. The Net Asset 
 Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 
(ii) 
the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value”; 
and/or 
 
(iii) 
the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in the 
Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will solely be entitled to look to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and an Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds in 
payment of all claims of an Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if 
any) of the Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the 
Fund, such claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be 
automatically extinguished, (b) an Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in 
respect thereof and (c) an Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of 
 the Company as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowing 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. The Fund will not borrow for investment 
 purposes.

 There are no dividend entitlements in respect of any Share Classes.

the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Fees of the Management Company, 
Extraordinary Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. 
Additionally, the Fixed Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg as disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of 
 doubt, please note that Transaction Fees (as defined below) are excluded from Fixed Fees. 
 Transaction Fees

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
Certain risks relating to the Shares are set out under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus. 
 In addition, Shareholders should note that: 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE 
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
 ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND IS TO PROVIDE THE INVESTORS WITH A 
 RETURN LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING. 
General Risks related to Investment in the Fund 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that any 
dividends will be paid. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
The Fund is a sub-fund of the Company. The sub-funds of the Company are segregated 
as a matter of Luxembourg law and as such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund 
will not be available to satisfy the liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be 
noted that the Company is a single legal entity which may operate or have assets held 
on its behalf or be subject to claims in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily 
recognise such segregation. There can be no guarantee that the courts of any 
jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
Market Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s performance is related to the performance of the Fund Assets. The Fund 
is therefore exposed to general market movements and trends in money market, 
equities, emerging markets equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and 
volatility, which are occasionally partially affected by irrational factors. Such factors 
may lead to a more significant and longer lasting decline in prices affecting the entire 
market. 
 
Strategy and Investment Risks 
 
(a) 
The Allocation Strategy employed by the Investment Manager, based on the advice of 
the Investment Advisor, aims to generate an optimal allocation to the constituents, as 
described in the section “General Description of the Underlying – Allocation Strategy”. 
There is, however, no assurance that the strategy will succeed, and consequently, the 
Fund may fail to achieve its Investment Objective. 
(b) 
The Investment Manager retains certain discretion in respect of the application of 

 <Page185>  
 
185 
 
Allocation Strategy to determine the composition of the Fund, as disclosed in the 
section “General Description of the Underlying – Allocation Strategy”. While such 
discretion will be exercised by the Investment Manager with a view to achieve the 
Investment Objective of the Fund, there is no assurance that the Investment Objective 
will always be achieved. 
 
(c) 
The Fund will be subject to certain costs, including transaction costs (which may 
include, without limitation, a buy-sell spread) when investing in certain constituents, as 
disclosed in the section on “Transaction Fees”. Such fees or costs will affect the Net 
Asset Value per Share of the Fund. 
 
FDI Risks 
 
(a) 
Certain types of assets such as FDIs may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market 
 conditions, and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
(b) 
The OTC derivative transactions may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon 
the occurrence of certain events with respect to either an Approved Counterparty or the 
Fund (for example failure to pay, insolvency or the imposition of withholding tax on the 
payments due by either party). Upon termination of a FDI, the Fund or the relevant 
Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment (regardless of 
which party may have caused such termination) based on the marked to market value 
of such FDI at such time, as determined in accordance with the terms of such FDI. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may gain exposure to some or all of the constituents via FDIs. Shareholders 
will not have direct ownership rights (including, without limitation, voting rights) with 
respect to such constituents if FDIs are used. If the Fund has any ownership rights 
(including, without limitation, voting rights) with respect to the constituents, the Fund 
may exercise such rights at its sole discretion without taking into account the request of 
any investor. 
 
(d) 
The return payable under FDIs with an Approved Counterparty is subject to the credit 
risk of such Approved Counterparty. In the event that the risk exposure to an Approved 
Counterparty in such a FDI exceeds the limits prescribed by the Authority, such 
Approved Counterparty is required to provide collateral to the Fund such that the risk 
exposure to such Approved Counterparty is limited in accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations. On the bankruptcy or insolvency of an Approved Counterparty, 
the Fund may experience delays in liquidating the positions taken and may incur 
significant losses, including declines in the value of its investment or the collateral 
posted by such Approved Counterparty during the period in which the Fund seeks to 
enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment or the collateral during 
such period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. 
 
(e) 
An Approved Counterparty is likely to act as Calculation Agent under a FDI. In such 
circumstances Shareholders should note that there may be potential conflicts of interest 
in the performance of the function of Calculation Agent by such entity. In circumstances, 
where an Approved Counterparty acts as Calculation Agent, such Approved 
Counterparty will use its reasonable endeavours to resolve any such conflicts of interest 
fairly (having regard to its respective obligations and duties) and to ensure that the 
interests of the Company and the Shareholders are not unfairly prejudiced. In addition, 
and to the extent that Barclays Bank PLC acts as an Approved Counterparty and 
Calculation Agent, the operational risks arising from any such potential lack of 
independence are in part reduced by the fact that different divisions within Barclays 
Bank PLC will be responsible for the different roles.

CIS and ETF Risks 
 
(a) 
Each CIS or ETF in which the Fund invests may have a different settlement cycle than 
that of the Fund. Thus, there may be mismatch between the two settlement cycles 
causing the Company, on behalf of the Fund, to use borrowing on a temporary basis to 
meet such obligations, subject to the available limits. This may result in charges being 
incurred by the Fund. Any such borrowing will comply with the UCITS guidelines. 
Further, each CIS may not be valued at the same time or on the same day as the Fund 
and accordingly, the net asset value of each CIS used in the calculation of the Net Asset 
Value of the Fund will be the latest available net asset value of such CIS as at the 
Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day or the probable realisation value as 
estimated in good faith by the Directors (further details on the calculation of Net Asset 
Value of the Fund are set out in the Prospectus under “Share Dealings – Calculation of 
Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets”). 
 
(b) 
The investment decisions of the underlying CIS or ETFs which the Fund may invest in, 
are made by their investment managers or advisors; such investment decisions are 
independent from the Investment Manager’s investment decisions for the Fund. The 
Investment Manager does not take responsibility for the investment decisions made by 
the investment managers or advisor of these underlying CIS or ETFs. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may invest in CIS or ETFs which use leverage or other forms of financial 
derivatives, such as futures and options. As such, investment in the Fund may be more 
volatile than investment in other funds. 
 
(d) 
The underlying CIS or ETFs investing in swap(s) and/or financial derivative instruments 
will be exposed to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty trading with 
the relevant underlying CIS or ETF will be unable to meet its obligation to make 
payments or to settle a trade. Moreover, should a counterparty become bankrupt or 
insolvent, such underlying CIS or ETF may incur significant losses, including declines 
in the value of its investment during the period in which the relevant underlying CIS or 
ETF seeks to enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment during 
such period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. There is also a 
possibility that the above transactions may be terminated due to certain events, such 
as bankruptcy, supervening illegality or change in the tax or accounting laws relative to 
 those in force at the time the transactions were entered into. 
(e) 
The Fund may invest in CIS and/or ETFs eligible for UCITS whose net asset value is 
calculated by the same entity in charge of the asset management (i.e. their management 
company), which may involve a greater risk of administrative error and/or conflict of 
interest due to potentially differing degrees of segregation with respect to the 
management duties and the pricing of the portfolio in the business model employed by 
such CIS and/or ETFs as compared with a CIS or ETF that is externally administered. 
 
(f) 
The Fund may invest in emerging markets debt securities, equities or currencies directly 
or via CIS, ETFs, FDIs. Investment in emerging markets may increase the volatility of 
the Fund’s Net Asset Value. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund’s Shares may be 
worth more or less on redemption than their original purchase value. Investing in 
emerging markets involves additional risks and special considerations not typically 
associated with investing in other more established economies or securities markets. 
Such risks may include (1) restrictions on foreign investment and on repatriation of 
capital invested in emerging markets, (2) currency fluctuations, (3) potential price 
volatility and lesser liquidity of securities traded in emerging markets, (4) economic and 
political risks, including the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets or 
confiscatory taxation, (5) risks related to custodial arrangements and delays or other 
factors in the settlement of securities transactions, and (6) accounting, auditing, 
financial and other reporting standards in emerging markets are not equivalent to those 

 <Page187>  
 
187 
 
in more developed markets. Many of the laws that govern private investment, securities 
transactions and other contractual relationships in emerging countries are new and 
largely untested. As a result, the Fund may be subject to a number of unusual risks, 
including inadequate investor protection, contradictory legislation, incomplete, unclear 
and changing laws, ignorance or breaches of regulations on the part of other market 
participants, lack of established or effective avenues for legal redress, lack of standard 
practices and confidentiality customs characteristic of developed markets and lack of 
enforcement of existing regulations. Furthermore, it may be difficult to obtain and 
enforce a judgment in certain of the emerging countries in which assets of the Fund are 
invested. There can be no assurance that this difficulty in protecting and enforcing rights 
will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund and its operations. Regulatory 
controls and corporate governance of companies in emerging countries confer little 
protection on minority shareholders. Anti-fraud and anti-insider trading legislation is 
often rudimentary. The concept of fiduciary duty to shareholders by officers and 
directors is also limited when compared to such concepts in developed markets. In 
certain instances management may take significant actions without the consent of 
shareholders and anti-dilution protection also may be limited. 
 
Currency Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s foreign currency exposure may be hedged at the Investment Manager’s 
discretion, fully, partially or not at all. Investors should note that some or all of the 
constituents may be denominated in currencies different from the Base Currency of the 
Fund and as such, the Fund will be exposed to the fluctuation in exchange rates which 
may adversely affect the value of the Shares. Exchange rates between currencies are 
determined by a number of factors including (but not limited to) the supply and demand 
in the international currency markets, which are influenced by macro economic factors 
(such as the economic development in the different currency areas, interest rates and 
international capital movements), speculation and central bank and government policies 
(including the imposition of currency controls and restrictions). Investors should also 
note that their investment may be exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates if the Base 
Currency of the Fund and/or the currency in which the investment(s) of the Fund is 
denominated in is different from the currency in which they subscribe for Shares in the 
Fund. 
 
(b) 
With respect to currency hedging, hedging against a decline in the value of the Fund’s 
positions does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of the positions of the relevant 
Share Class or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline as a result of 
movements in currency exchange rates, but establishes other positions designed to gain 
from those same developments, thus offsetting the decline in the value of the Fund’s 
positions. Such hedging transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the 
Fund’s positions should increase. It may not be possible for the Fund to hedge against 
a change or event at a price sufficient to protect its assets from the decline in value of 
the positions of the relevant Share Class anticipated as a result of such change. In 
addition, it may not be possible to hedge against certain changes or events at all, or the 
Investment Manager may choose not to hedge all or any of the Fund’s exposure or may 
choose to execute the hedge for only certain Share Classes. 
 
 Other Risks 
(a) 
If a Disruption Event occurs, the Directors may make such determinations and/or 
adjustments to the terms of the Fund as considered appropriate to determine the value 
of any Fund Asset. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment. If a 
Market Disruption Event occurs and the Administrator is unable to calculate the Net 
Asset Value of the Fund, the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the 
Net Asset Value until the day the Administrator is able to calculate the Net Asset Value 
of the Fund. The Directors may also make adjustments to determine the value of the 
Fund Assets; temporarily suspend the calculation of Net Asset Value and any 

 <Page188>  
 
188 
 
subscription, redemption or exchange of Shares; and/or terminate the Fund, in each 
case, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles.

 determines affects any Fund Asset. 
Market Disruption Event means one or more of the following events, which occur in relation to 
 any Fund Asset, and if, in the sole discretion of the Investment Manager, such event is material: 
(i)

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The Investment Objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with medium capital growth over 
the long term with a medium level of risk. The Fund will invest in a wide range of global asset 
classes as more fully described in the section “General Description of the Underlying” below. The 
allocation between individual assets is determined semi-annually based on the Allocation Strategy. 
This strategy uses economic data and analysis of asset prices to generate allocation 
recommendations which will be implemented by the Investment Manager, based on the investment 
advice provided periodically by the Investment Advisor, and is more fully described in the section 
 “General Description of the Underlying”.  
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the Investment Objective. The Fund is 
 neither capital protected nor guaranteed.  
 Investment Policy 
In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund may invest in Transferable Securities, 
Money Market Instruments (including deposits), FDIs, open-ended exchange-traded funds (“ETF”) 
and collective investment schemes (“CIS”), although it is intended that the Fund will mainly invest 
 in such asset classes indirectly through investment funds. 
 The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. 
 General Description of the Underlying 
(A) 
Underlying 
 
In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund will invest in a wide range of global asset 
classes including but not limited to shares (including Norwegian shares and emerging market 
shares), fixed income (rates instruments and bonds issued by corporate bodies and governments, 
including Norwegian corporate and government bonds), foreign exchange, commodity-linked 
instruments (qualified as eligible transferable securities according to the article 41(1) of the Law 
and the Grand Ducal regulation of 8 February 2008) and infrastructure-related securities, share 
volatility instruments and money market instruments. The Fund will mainly invest in these asset 
classes indirectly through investment funds (including open-ended exchange-traded funds 
 (“ETF”)). 
The composition of the Fund is rebalanced by the Investment Manager on each Semi-Annual 
Rebalancing Date in accordance with the Allocation Strategy, whereby a long position may be 
 taken in any of the eligible assets and instruments, subject to any regulatory limitations.  
The Investment Manager may also add or remove eligible assets and instruments in its sole 
         discretion, but at all times in accordance with the Law and any regulatory limitations. 

 <Page195>  
 
195 
 
(B) 
Allocation Strategy 
 
The Investment Advisor shall provide advice to the Investment Manager in accordance with an 
investment advisory agreement entered into between the Investment Manager and the Investment 
Advisor. The advice may comprise the asset classes, assets and exposures within the limits set 
out below unless otherwise agreed by the Investment Manager, all as may be amended and agreed 
 in writing between the Investment Advisor and the Investment Manager from time to time.

The Allocation Strategy combines analysis of economic data and investment research with a 
discretionary oversight and is used to generate the target allocation to the Fund’s assets or 
 constituents on each Semi-Annual Allocation Date for the following six-month investment horizon.  
 The Allocation Strategy broadly comprises the following steps: 
(i) 
strategy allocation (i.e. an allocation decision between the main asset classes); 
(ii) 
global diversification (including international assets to diversify Norwegian exposures); 
(iii) 
on-going monitoring of the portfolio. 
 
 The fund composition will be notified to Shareholders in ongoing monthly reporting. 
Where the Fund gains exposures to Norwegian shares and bonds, it is intended that the Fund will 
mainly invest in investment funds managed by Pareto Nordic Investments AS and Pareto 
Forvaltning AS, which form part of the same group of companies as the Investment Advisor. 
Additionally, the Fund may invest in investment funds which are managed by the Investment 
 Manager or an affiliated entity. 
(C) 
Rebalancing 
 
Under normal market conditions, the composition of the Fund is rebalanced on each Semi-Annual 
 Rebalancing Date, provided that: 
(i) 
the Investment Manager may choose to accept or reject the advice received from the 
Investment Advisor and instead determine the composition of the Fund and the respective 
allocations to any constituents in its sole discretion in order to achieve the Investment Objective of 
 the Fund; and 
(ii) 
the Investment Manager in its sole discretion where deemed appropriate in order to 
achieve the Investment Objective, may, from time to time between successive Semi-Annual 
Rebalancing Dates, modify the composition of the Fund, including putting in place hedging 
arrangements with respect to some or all of the constituents, or even reducing the allocation to 
zero. Where the exposure to some or all constituents is reduced to zero, the Fund will invest the 
balance in Money Market Instruments and fixed income securities in the form of short-dated 
sovereign bonds. The Fund will subsequently reinvest in the constituents selected in accordance 
with the Allocation Strategy, either on the immediately following Semi-Annual Rebalancing Date or 
 earlier, as determined by the Investment Manager. 
 Investment Restrictions 
The general Investment Restrictions set out in the Prospectus apply to this Fund. 
The Fund will not invest more than 20% of its assets in asset-backed securities and mortgage 
backed securities.

 Global Exposure 
In accordance with the Law and applicable regulations, the Fund's global exposure through the use 
of FDIs will not exceed the total value of the Fund’s net assets in accordance with the commitment 
  approach. 
 Valuation 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day in order to determine 
 the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out in the Prospectus. 
 Use of FDIs  
The Fund may gain exposure to the Underlying through FDIs (including futures, forwards, Options 
and/or swaps). They may also be used for efficient portfolio management purposes, as further 
detailed under “Currency Hedging”, and used to hedge the exposure of the Fund to interest rates, 
 equities, currencies and other risks. 
Each Approved Counterparty to the FDI will be required to provide collateral to the Company so 
that the Company's risk exposure to the relevant Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent 
required by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
 Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs will have a fixed maturity and may also be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events 
with respect to either the Fund or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event 
of default (such as a failure to pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event 
(which is not the fault of either party, for example, illegality or a tax event) or a Disruption Event. In 
each case the FDI will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter 
into new FDIs with other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the financial asset 
 classes. 
The Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with the Authority. 
The Fund will only invest in FDIs in accordance with this risk management policy. The 
Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to Shareholders relating to 
the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative limits that are applied 
and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of the main categories of 
 investments. 
 Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that the Fund does not use TRS. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
  Share Class. 

 <Page197>

 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
will be paid in cash or made in specie in compliance with the Articles. If a Shareholder that is 
requesting redemption of Shares consents, the Company will have the right to satisfy payment of 
the Repurchase Price by allocating assets from the Fund to such Shareholder which are equal in 
value to the value of the Shares being redeemed. The nature and type of such assets shall be 
determined on both a pro rata basis and on a fair and reasonable basis, with due regard to all 
applicable laws and regulations and will take into account the interests of the remaining 
Shareholders. The valuation used shall be confirmed by a report of the Company's auditor. The 
 costs of any such redemption in specie shall be borne by the redeeming Shareholder. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; (c) dealing charges, taxes and 
other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and (d) payments 
 of any dividend. 
The Subscription Price or Repurchase Price may be adjusted respectively in accordance with the 
Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no subscription or redemption in 
the Fund or a specific Share Class on the relevant Dealing Day, the Subscription Price or the 
Repurchase Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share Class rounded downwards to 
 such number of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
The following table gives an example of the effect that holding of cash in the Fund has on the 
percentage performance of the Fund Assets when translated into the Net Asset Value per Share. 
The figures included in the following table are purely illustrative and should not be 
understood as indicators of potential performance of the Fund.

The example shown in the table assumes that the Fund holds only Fund assets and ancillary cash 
and is collateralised to the extent required by the Law and applicable regulations. It also assumes 
a constant investment with no additional subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without 
 deduction of any fees or expenses. 
 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good faith, 
make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets. The Net Asset 
 Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 

 <Page198>  
 
198 
 
(ii) 
the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the provisions 
of the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value”; 
and/or 
 
(iii) 
the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in the 
Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will solely be entitled to look to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and an Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds in 
payment of all claims of an Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if 
any) of the Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the 
Fund, such claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be 
automatically extinguished, (b) an Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in 
respect thereof and (c) an Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of 
 the Company as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowing 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. The Fund will not borrow for investment 
 purposes. 
 Dividend Policy 
 There are no dividend entitlements in respect of any Share Classes.

1 the Management Fee, which represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share 
Class (plus VAT, if any) is subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1.250 EUR per Fund. The 
Management Fee is payable by the Company out of the Fund to the Management Company. The 
Management Fee will accrue daily and be calculated on each Dealing Day. The fees of the 
Investment Manager, Investment Advisor, Distributor, Sub-Distributor or any third party will be 
payable out of the Management Fee and not out of the assets of the Fund. Neither the Management 
Company, the Investment Manager, the Investment Advisor, the Distributor, Sub-Distributor or any 
third party will be entitled to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their respective out-of-
 pocket expenses. 
2 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share Class is payable by the Company for 
the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Fees of the Management Company, 
Extraordinary Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. 
Additionally, the Fixed Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg as disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of 
 doubt, please note that Transaction Fees (as defined below) are excluded from Fixed Fees. 
 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees means certain costs which may be incurred in respect of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, any fees charged by an Approved Counterparty to an FDI, collateral 
costs that may be charged in relation to FDIs, brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads 
and licensing fees. The Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund will be calculated net of such costs, 
which may affect the performance of the Fund.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
Certain risks relating to the Shares are set out under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus. 
 In addition, Shareholders should note that: 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE 
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
 ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND IS TO PROVIDE THE INVESTORS WITH A 
 RETURN LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING. 
General Risks related to Investment in the Fund 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
 they originally invested. 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that any 
dividends will be paid. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
The Fund is a sub-fund of the Company. The sub-funds of the Company are 
segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as such, in Luxembourg, the assets of 
one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the liabilities of another sub-fund. However, 
it should be noted that the Company is a single legal entity which may operate or have 
assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims in other jurisdictions which may not 
necessarily recognise such segregation. There can be no guarantee that the courts of 
any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the limitations on liability as set out 
above. 
 
Market Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s performance is related to the performance of the Fund Assets. The Fund is 
therefore exposed to general market movements and trends in money market, equities, 
emerging markets equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and volatility, which 
are occasionally partially affected by irrational factors. Such factors may lead to a more 
significant and longer lasting decline in prices affecting the entire market. 
 
Strategy and Investment Risks 
 
(a) 
The Allocation Strategy employed by the Investment Manager, based on the advice of 
the Investment Advisor, aims to generate an optimal allocation to the constituents, as 
described in the section “General Description of the Underlying – Allocation Strategy”. 
There is, however, no assurance that the strategy will succeed, and consequently, the 
Fund may fail to achieve its Investment Objective. 

 <Page202>  
 
202 
 
 
(b) 
The Investment Manager retains certain discretion in respect of the application of 
Allocation Strategy to determine the composition of the Fund, as disclosed in the 
section “General Description of the Underlying – Allocation Strategy”. While such 
discretion will be exercised by the Investment Manager with a view to achieve the 
Investment Objective of the Fund, there is no assurance that the Investment Objective 
will always be achieved. 
 
(c) 
The Fund will be subject to certain costs, including transaction costs (which may 
include, without limitation, a buy-sell spread) when investing in certain constituents, as 
disclosed in the section on “Transaction Fees”. Such fees or costs will affect the Net 
Asset Value per Share of the Fund. 
 
FDI Risks 
 
(a) 
Certain types of assets such as FDIs may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market 
conditions, and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(b) 
The OTC derivative transactions may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon 
the occurrence of certain events with respect to either an Approved Counterparty or the 
Fund (for example failure to pay, insolvency or the imposition of withholding tax on the 
payments due by either party). Upon termination of a FDI, the Fund or the relevant 
Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment (regardless of 
which party may have caused such termination) based on the marked to market value 
of such FDI at such time, as determined in accordance with the terms of such FDI. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may gain exposure to some or all of the constituents via FDIs. Shareholders 
will not have direct ownership rights (including, without limitation, voting rights) with 
respect to such constituents if FDIs are used. If the Fund has any ownership rights 
(including, without limitation, voting rights) with respect to the constituents, the Fund 
may exercise such rights at its sole discretion without taking into account the request of 
any investor. 
 
(d) 
The return payable under FDIs with an Approved Counterparty is subject to the credit 
risk of such Approved Counterparty. In the event that the risk exposure to an Approved 
Counterparty in such a FDI exceeds the limits prescribed by the Authority, such 
Approved Counterparty is required to provide collateral to the Fund such that the risk 
exposure to such Approved Counterparty is limited in accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations. On the bankruptcy or insolvency of an Approved Counterparty, 
the Fund may experience delays in liquidating the positions taken and may incur 
significant losses, including declines in the value of its investment or the collateral posted 
by such Approved Counterparty during the period in which the Fund seeks to enforce 
its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment or the collateral during such 
period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. 
 
(e) 
An Approved Counterparty is likely to act as Calculation Agent under a FDI. In such 
circumstances Shareholders should note that there may be potential conflicts of interest 
in the performance of the function of Calculation Agent by such entity. In circumstances, 
where an Approved Counterparty acts as Calculation Agent, such Approved 
Counterparty will use its reasonable endeavours to resolve any such conflicts of interest 
fairly (having regard to its respective obligations and duties) and to ensure that the 
interests of the Company and the Shareholders are not unfairly prejudiced. In addition, 
and to the extent that Barclays Bank PLC acts as an Approved Counterparty and 
Calculation Agent, the operational risks arising from any such potential lack of 
independence are in part reduced by the fact that different divisions within Barclays 
Bank PLC will be responsible for the different roles. 
 
 

 <Page203>

CIS and ETF Risks 
 
(a) 
Each CIS or ETF in which the Fund invests may have a different settlement cycle than 
that of the Fund. Thus, there may be mismatch between the two settlement cycles 
causing the Company, on behalf of the Fund, to use borrowing on a temporary basis 
to meet such obligations, subject to the available limits. This may result in charges 
being incurred by the Fund. Any such borrowing will comply with the UCITS guidelines. 
Further, each CIS may not be valued at the same time or on the same day as the Fund 
and accordingly, the net asset value of each CIS used in the calculation of the Net 
Asset Value of the Fund will be the latest available net asset value of such CIS as at 
the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day or the probable realisation value as 
estimated in good faith by the Directors (further details on the calculation of Net Asset 
Value of the Fund are set out in the Prospectus under “Share Dealings – Calculation 
of Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets”). 
 
(b) 
The investment decisions of the underlying CIS or ETFs which the Fund may invest in, 
are made by their investment managers or advisors; such investment decisions are 
independent from the Investment Manager’s investment decisions for the Fund. The 
Investment Manager does not take responsibility for the investment decisions made by 
the investment managers or advisor of these underlying CIS or ETFs. 
 
(c) 
The Fund may invest in CIS or ETFs which use leverage or other forms of financial 
derivatives, such as futures and options. As such, investment in the Fund may be more 
volatile than investment in other funds. 
 
(d) 
The underlying CIS or ETFs investing in swap(s) and/or financial derivative instruments 
will be exposed to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty trading with 
the relevant underlying CIS or ETF will be unable to meet its obligation to make 
payments or to settle a trade. Moreover, should a counterparty become bankrupt or 
insolvent, such underlying CIS or ETF may incur significant losses, including declines 
in the value of its investment during the period in which the relevant underlying CIS or 
ETF seeks to enforce its rights, inability to realise any gains on its investment during 
such period and fees and expenses incurred in enforcing its rights. There is also a 
possibility that the above transactions may be terminated due to certain events, such 
as bankruptcy, supervening illegality or change in the tax or accounting laws relative 
 to those in force at the time the transactions were entered into. 
(e) 
The Fund may invest in CIS and/or ETFs eligible for UCITS whose net asset value is 
calculated by the same entity in charge of the asset management (i.e. their 
management company), which may involve a greater risk of administrative error and/or 
conflict of interest due to potentially differing degrees of segregation with respect to the 
management duties and the pricing of the portfolio in the business model employed by 
such CIS and/or ETFs as compared with a CIS or ETF that is externally administered. 
 
Risks related to investment in Emerging Markets 
 
(a) 
The Fund may invest in emerging markets debt securities, equities or currencies 
directly or via CIS, ETFs, FDIs. Investment in emerging markets may increase the 
volatility of the Fund’s Net Asset Value. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund’s 
Shares may be worth more or less on redemption than their original purchase value. 
Investing in emerging markets involves additional risks and special considerations not 
typically associated with investing in other more established economies or securities 
markets. Such risks may include (1) restrictions on foreign investment and on 
repatriation of capital invested in emerging markets, (2) currency fluctuations, (3) 
potential price volatility and lesser liquidity of securities traded in emerging markets, 
(4) economic and political risks, including the risk of nationalization or expropriation of 
assets or confiscatory taxation, (5) risks related to custodial arrangements and delays 

 <Page204>  
 
204 
 
or other factors in the settlement of securities transactions, and (6) accounting, 
auditing, financial and other reporting standards in emerging markets are not 
equivalent to those in more developed markets. Many of the laws that govern private 
investment, securities transactions and other contractual relationships in emerging 
countries are new and largely untested. As a result, the Fund may be subject to a 
number of unusual risks, including inadequate investor protection, contradictory 
legislation, incomplete, unclear and changing laws, ignorance or breaches of 
regulations on the part of other market participants, lack of established or effective 
avenues for legal redress, lack of standard practices and confidentiality customs 
characteristic of developed markets and lack of enforcement of existing regulations. 
Furthermore, it may be difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment in certain of the 
emerging countries in which assets of the Fund are invested. There can be no 
assurance that this difficulty in protecting and enforcing rights will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Fund and its operations. Regulatory controls and corporate 
governance of companies in emerging countries confer little protection on minority 
shareholders. Anti-fraud and anti-insider trading legislation is often rudimentary. The 
concept of fiduciary duty to shareholders by officers and directors is also limited when 
compared to such concepts in developed markets. In certain instances management 
may take significant actions without the consent of shareholders and anti-dilution 
protection also may be limited. 
 
Currency Risks 
 
(a) 
The Fund’s foreign currency exposure may be hedged at the Investment Manager’s 
discretion, fully, partially or not at all. Investors should note that some or all of the 
constituents may be denominated in currencies different from the Base Currency of 
the Fund and as such, the Fund will be exposed to the fluctuation in exchange rates 
which may adversely affect the value of the Shares. Exchange rates between 
currencies are determined by a number of factors including (but not limited to) the 
supply and demand in the international currency markets, which are influenced by 
macro economic factors (such as the economic development in the different currency 
areas, interest rates and international capital movements), speculation and central 
bank and government policies (including the imposition of currency controls and 
restrictions). Investors should also note that their investment may be exposed to 
fluctuations in exchange rates if the Base Currency of the Fund and/or the currency in 
which the investment(s) of the Fund is denominated in is different from the currency in 
 which they subscribe for Shares in the Fund. 
(b) 
With respect to currency hedging, hedging against a decline in the value of the Fund’s 
positions does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of the positions of the relevant 
Share Class or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline as a result of 
movements in currency exchange rates, but establishes other positions designed to 
gain from those same developments, thus offsetting the decline in the value of the 
Fund’s positions. Such hedging transactions also limit the opportunity for gain if the 
value of the Fund’s positions should increase. It may not be possible for the Fund to 
hedge against a change or event at a price sufficient to protect its assets from the 
decline in value of the positions of the relevant Share Class anticipated as a result of 
such change. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge against certain changes or 
events at all, or the Investment Manager may choose not to hedge all or any of the 
Fund’s exposure or may choose to execute the hedge for only certain Share Classes. 
 
Other Risks 
 
(a) 
If a Disruption Event occurs, the Directors may make such determinations and/or 
adjustments to the terms of the Fund as considered appropriate to determine the value 
of any Fund Asset. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment. If a 
Market Disruption Event occurs and the Administrator is unable to calculate the Net 
Asset Value of the Fund, the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the 

 <Page205>  
 
205 
 
Net Asset Value until the day the Administrator is able to calculate the Net Asset Value 
of the Fund. The Directors may also make adjustments to determine the value of the 
Fund Assets; temporarily suspend the calculation of Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, redemption or exchange of Shares; and/or terminate the Fund, in each 
case, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles. 
 
 Disclaimers 
THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND THE 
INVESTMENT MANAGER (TOGETHER THE "RESPONSIBLE PARTIES") MAKE NO EXPRESS

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The Investment Objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with long-term capital appreciation 
through a portfolio of Eligible Indices which includes (i) an allocation to commodity market beta, via 
the Commodity Market Beta Indices and (ii) long/short commodity exposures via Commodity 
Capped Component Indices, both being commodity-related exposures and accessed via 
commodity futures-based indices, as further described in the section “Universe of Eligible Indices” 
 under “General Description of the Underlying”.  
The Portfolio is constructed and rebalanced by the Investment Manager based on the Model 
Portfolio and Model Portfolio Weights pursuant to the Asset Allocation Process of the Allocation 
 Advisor.  
The Shareholders will receive the performance of the Underlying net of fees and expenses as 
further described under “Transaction Fees” and “Fees and Expenses” below. Therefore, the 
return Shareholders may receive may not wholly correspond to the performance of the Underlying, 
as more particularly described in the Prospectus. Additionally, the return Shareholders may receive 
may not correspond to the performance of the Underlying under certain exceptional circumstances 
 such as disruptive market conditions, extremely volatile markets or liquidity or trading constraints. 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. This Fund is not 
 capital protected nor is it guaranteed. 
 Investment Policy and Fund Assets 
In order to achieve the investment objective and gain exposure to the Portfolio, the Fund shall 
invest in Fund Assets, including Funded Swaps and Unfunded Swaps, with the Approved 
 Counterparty.  
Where the Fund enters into Unfunded Swaps, it may invest any remaining cash in Money Market 
Instruments or fixed income investments . The Fund shall enter into such Swaps, Money Market 
Instruments and fixed income investments at the discretion of the Investment Manager. The fixed 
income investments may be based on a recommended portfolio of fixed income investments 
provided by the Allocation Advisor from time to time. Swaps entered into by the Fund are more fully 
 described under “Use of FDIs” below.  
The Fund may also invest in FDIs as further described under “Efficient Portfolio Management” 
 below, and may also hold ancillary cash positions in various currencies. 
 The Fund is actively managed without reference to any benchmark. 
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor seeking (i) capital appreciation, (ii) exposure to commodities 
 and (iii) who is prepared to accept a high degree of volatility. 
 Valuation 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day in order to determine 
 the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out in the Prospectus. 
Further information relevant to the Fund’s investment policy is contained in the main part of the 
Prospectus under “Investment Objectives and Policies” and under “Investment Restrictions”. 

 <Page214>  
 
214 
 
 
 Investment Restrictions 
The Fund will not invest more than 10% of its net assets in units of other UCITS or other Collective 
 Investment Schemes. 
Subject to the above, the general investment restrictions set out under "Funds – Investment 
 Restrictions" in the Prospectus apply to the Fund. 
 Tracking Difference/Tracking Error 
Investment in the Fund should not be considered to provide a direct investment in the Indices 
comprising the Portfolio, as the Fund gains exposure to the Indices via one or more Unfunded 
Swaps (or Funded Swaps), and the Fund will not invest directly in components of the Indices. In 
normal market conditions, the Fund can be expected to match the performance of the Portfolio 
(less fees and associated costs as further described under “Transaction Fees” and “Fees and 
 Expenses” below).  
Tracking Error should be differentiated from the tracking difference, which is simply the difference 
between the return of the Fund and the return of the Portfolio, over a given period of time (the 
“Tracking Difference”). The Tracking Difference indicates the extent to which a Fund has 
outperformed or underperformed the Portfolio. In contrast, the Tracking Error measures how 
consistently the Fund return matches the Portfolio. Hence, while the Tracking Difference shows 
how a Fund’s performance compares with that of the Portfolio over a given period of time, the 
 Tracking Error indicates the consistency of the difference of return during this same period of time. 
 Leverage 
 The Fund may be leveraged for the purpose of investment, through the use of Swaps.  
The level of leverage, based on the sum of all expected notional amounts is expected to be, a 
maximum of, 400% of the Net Asset Value. The source of such leverage comes from the long/short 
positions on the Eligible Indices included in the Portfolio. The Company employs an absolute value-
at-risk (Absolute VaR) based approach as part of its risk management process which enables it to 
accurately measure, monitor and manage the various risks associated with the Swaps used by the 
Fund. The use of Swaps by the Fund should result in the Fund having the volatility characteristics 
of the Portfolio. Upon request, the Company may provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative limits 
that are applied. The global net exposure (summing long/short commodity exposures underlying 
the financial indices in the Portfolio) of the Fund to derivatives instruments is expected to equal 
 100% of the Fund Assets.  
 The Fund will not borrow for investment purposes. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
 will be done in cash or in specie in compliance with the Articles. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; and (c) dealing charges, taxes 
 and other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets. 

 <Page215>  
 
215 
 
The Subscription Price or Repurchase Price may be adjusted respectively in accordance with the 
Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no subscription or redemption in 
the Fund or a specific Share Class on the relevant Dealing Day, the Subscription Price or the 
Repurchase Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share Class rounded downwards to 
 such number of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
The following table gives an example of the effect that holding of cash in the Fund has on 
percentage performance of the Fund Asset when translated into the Net Asset Value per Share. 
The figures included in the following table are purely illustrative and should not be understood as 
indicators of potential performance of the Fund.

The examples shown in the table assume that the Fund holds only Swaps and ancillary cash and 
is collateralised to the extent required by the Law, and is receiving the performance of the Portfolio 
pursuant to the Swaps (see “Use of Derivative Contract” below). It also assumes a constant 
investment with no additional subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without deduction of 
 any fees or expenses. 
 Use of FDIs 
 The Fund may gain exposure to the Eligible Indices comprising the Portfolio through Swaps.  
The Fund may also use FDIs (including futures, forwards, options and/or Swaps) for efficient 
portfolio management purposes, as further detailed under “Currency Hedging”, and used to hedge 
 the exposure of the Fund to interest rates, equities, currencies and other risks. 
The Approved Counterparty to the FDIs will be required to provide collateral to the Company so 
that the Company's risk exposure to the Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent required 
by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
 Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs will have a fixed maturity and may also be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events 
with respect to either the Fund or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event 
of default (such as a failure to pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event 
(which is not the fault of either party, for example, illegality or a tax event) or a Disruption Event. In 
each case the FDI will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter 
into new FDIs with other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the financial asset 
 classes. 
The Management Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with 
the CSSF. Any investment in FDIs will be made in accordance with this risk management 
policy. The Management Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative 
limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of 
 the main categories of investments. 

 <Page216>  
 
216 
 
Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that, with the advice of the Investment Manager, 
 the Fund uses TRS in order to gain exposure to all or part of the Underlying.  
The expected and maximum proportion of the total assets which may be subject to TRS is 
summarized in the table below. In certain circumstances this proportion may be higher.

 Automatic Termination of the Fund 
 Under the terms of the Swaps providing exposure to the Indices comprising the Portfolio, the 
Approved Counterparty has the right to terminate the Swap with 6 months’ notice. Upon such event, 
the Fund may be invested in Money Market Instruments and may also hold ancillary cash positions, 
whilst the Investment Manager seeks to identify a suitable replacement Swap. If no suitable 
replacement can be found in order to achieve the Investment Objective of the Fund, the Fund will 
 be terminated automatically within one month from the date of notice of termination 
In the event of the termination of the Allocation Advisory Agreement in place between the Allocation 
Advisor and the Investment Manager, the Fund may allocate equally between the Eligible Indices 
as well as be invested in Money Market Instruments and ancillary cash positions until such time as 
a suitable replacement Allocation Advisor can be appointed. In the event that no such appointment 
can be made, and the Fund cannot achieve its original Investment Objective, the Fund will be 
 terminated automatically within one month from the date of notice of termination. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to the 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good faith, 
make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets and/or any 
constituents thereof. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 
 
(ii) the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value”; and/or 

 <Page217>  
 
217 
 
 
(iii) the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in the 
Prospectus, terminate the Fund.

A Shareholder will be entitled to look solely to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and the Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds of 
all claims of the Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the 
Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such 
claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically 
extinguished, (b) the Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof 
and (c) the Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company 
 as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
 Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. 
 Dividend Policy 
 There are no dividends in respect of any Class of Shares.

1 In accordance with and subject to the terms of the Management Company Agreement, the annual 
Management Fees, represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value (plus VAT, if any) of the 
relevant Share Class, subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1,250 EUR per Fund. Management 
Fees are payable periodically at a rate which is within the range specified above. The Management 
Fee will be calculated upon each Dealing Day. Fees payable to the Investment Manager, Allocation 
Advisor, Distributor (other than the Preliminary Charge) or Sub-Distributor, will be payable out of 
the Management Fee. The Management Company may instruct the Company to pay any such fees 
payable to the Investment Manager, Allocation Advisor, Distributor or Sub-Distributor, directly out 
of the assets of the Company. In such case, the portion of the Management Fee due to the 
Management Company will be reduced accordingly. Neither the Investment Manager nor the 
Distributor or Sub Distributor will be entitled to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their 
 respective out-of-pocket expenses. 
2 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share Class is payable by the Company for 
the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Fees of Management Fees, Extraordinary 
Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. Additionally, the Fixed 
Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as 
disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of doubt, please note 
 that Transaction Fees (as defined in the Prospectus) are excluded from Fixed Fees. 
 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees shall mean any costs in respect of buying and selling any of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, trading and administrative costs of entering into FDIs, transactional 
charges, collateral costs, brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads and licensing fees. 
The Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund will be calculated net of such costs, which may affect 
   the performance of the Fund.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING 
 
 
(A) 
The Portfolio 
 
The Portfolio is comprised of a basket of Eligible Indices whose allocation is based on the Allocation 
 Advice provided by the Allocation Advisor to the Investment Manager (i.e. the Indices). 
Eligible Indices in the Portfolio are composed of Commodity Capped Component Indices and 
Commodity Market Beta Indices, all of which track, directly or indirectly, commodity futures 
contracts. The Portfolio’s composition is expected to be rebalanced by the Investment Manager, 
 based on the Model Portfolio and Model Portfolio Weights. 
The Investment Manager gains exposure to the Indices on a best efforts basis and in its sole and 
absolute discretion, where such exposure is based on the Model Portfolio. The Model Portfolio and 
Model Portfolio Weights are determined as a result of the Asset Allocation Process, as described 
below. The Asset Allocation Process is based on the Allocation Advisor’s proprietary quantitative 
(model-based) and qualitative analysis, as detailed in Asset Allocation Process in the following 
section. The Allocation Advisor will provide either the Model Portfolio and Model Portfolio Weights 
or the Target Portfolio and Target Portfolio Weights as determined in accordance with the Asset 
 Allocation Process to the Investment Manager as Allocation Advice.  
The Investment Manager reserves the unilateral right to modify exposure to any component of the 
Portfolio in order to remain in compliance with Investment Restrictions or regulatory obligations. 
Should exposure to an Index within the Portfolio breach Investment Restrictions, the Investment 
Manager may, as soon as reasonably practicable, increase or decrease the allocation of the 
Portfolio to any single Index. In this situation, the Investment Manager may even remove or replace 
an Index within the Portfolio in order to be in compliance with the Investment Restrictions. As a 
result, the actual allocation to Indices within the Portfolio (i.e. the Portfolio Weights) may differ 
 materially from the Model Portfolio Weights. 
Due to certain constraints (including, but not limited to, adverse financial market conditions) or for 
any other reason it deems appropriate in the interests of the Fund and its Shareholders, the 
Investment Manager may also, at any time between successive Rebalancing Dates, modify the 
composition of the Portfolio, including putting in place hedging arrangements with respect to some 
or all of the constituents of the Portfolio, or even by having no allocation to the constituents of the 
Model Portfolio. Where the exposure to some or all of the constituents of the Portfolio is reduced 
to zero, the Fund may invest the balance in Money Market Instruments and/or fixed income 
securities in the form of short-dated government bonds. Such reduction in exposure to the Indices 
shall be on a temporary basis, while such constraints are continuing (as determined by the 
 Investment Manager in its sole discretion). 
(B) 
Asset Allocation Process 
 
 The Asset Allocation Process includes both quantitative (model-based) and qualitative elements. 
The quantitative portion of the Asset Allocation Process is based on momentum timing signals 
assessing the breadth of the commodity market. The qualitative portion of the Asset Allocation 
Process is based the Allocation Advisor’s views of the changing market, economic and political 
factors, market fundamentals, macro economic trends, and global or local events affecting 
 commodity markets and prices. 
The Asset Allocation Process, which determines the Model Portfolio and corresponding Model 
Portfolio Weights, seeks to capture long term total return through exposures to Eligible Indices. The 
Model Portfolio is a combination of (1) a long only allocation, made up of Commodity Market Beta 

 <Page222>  
 
222 
 
Indices which provide broad-based exposure to a diversified basket of commodities, and possibly 
(2) a tactical long/short commodity allocation, implemented through exposures to a basket of 
 Commodity Capped Component Indices.  
 Overview of Asset Allocation Process: 
i. 
Defining the set of Eligible Indices: The Allocation Advisor qualitatively and quantitatively 
screens currently Eligible Indices as well as potential eligible indices. The Eligible Indices 
can be categorized as either Commodity Market Beta Indices or Commodity Capped 
Component Indices. Commodity Market Beta Indices are financial indices that provide 
broad-based exposure to commodity markets. The Commodity Capped Component 
Indices are financial indices designed to be representative, transparent and diversified, and 
that that overweight a specific commodity up to a maximum of 35% with all other 
commodities being less than 20%. Once an index meets specific qualitative and 
quantitative criteria the index may be added to the universe of Eligible Indices (subject to 
written approval of the Investment Manager). The criteria for Commodity Market Beta 
Indices include broad-based exposure, liquidity of index components, efficient allocation 
mechanism, and the criteria for Commodity Capped Component Indices include liquidity of 
index components and efficient representation of targeted exposure to specific 
commodities. 
 
ii. 
Defining the Market Beta Index Weights: The Commodity Market Beta Indices aim to 
provide broad-based exposure to a diversified basket of commodities. The Commodity 
Market Beta Indices will track the performance of futures contracts, and will be rebalanced 
based on an index methodology which may take into account certain elements of the 
commodities markets, such as the shape of the futures curve, liquidity of the futures 
contract and production cycles of individual commodities. The allocations to each 
Commodity Market Beta Index (together the “Market Beta Index Weights”) will be 
determined by the Allocation Advisor based on qualitative and quantitative analysis on the 
commodities markets. The combined allocation to Commodity Market Beta Indices will 
range from 50% to 100% of the Model Portfolio and may include one or more Commodity 
Market Beta Indices. 
iii.  
Defining the Tactical Commodity Target Weights: an equally weighted dollar-neutral basket 
of long and short allocations to Eligible Tactical Commodities, the individual commodities 
as set out in “Eligible Tactical Commodities” under “General Description of the Underlying”, 
may be used to complement the fund’s Commodity Market Beta Index allocations. The 
basket will include 5 long and 5 short allocations to Eligible Tactical Commodities, and will 
be determined by the Allocation Advisor using quantitative models as well as views of the 
changing market, economic and political factors, market fundamentals, macroeconomic 
trends, and global or local events and will ensure the compliance with the Allocation 
Guidelines (including the weights to each commodity and the leverage). The combined 
total weight of the Eligible Tactical Commodities and the Market Beta Index Weights will 
be 100%, accordingly, the total of the allocations to Eligible Tactical Commodities will be 
between 0% and 50%. Each of the 5 long and 5 short positions will make up 1/10th of the 
allocation to Eligible Tactical Commodities (together the “Tactical Commodity Target 
Weights”). For example if Market Beta Index Weights totalled 60%, the Tactical 
Commodity Target Weights would total 40%, and each long allocation would be 4% and 
each short allocation would be 4%. 
iv.  
Deriving the Capped Component Index Weights: The Tactical Commodity Target Weights 
can be achieved through the use of specific allocations to multiple Commodity Capped 
Component Indices. A non-discretionary mathematical calculation based on the weights of 
the components in each of the Commodity Capped Component Indices is used to derive 
the allocations to Commodity Capped Component Indices that will, in combination, aim to 
track the Tactical Commodity Target Weights (together the “Capped Component Index 
Weights”). 

 <Page223>  
 
223 
 
v.  
Determination of the Model Portfolio Weights: The Model Portfolio consists of the Market 
 Beta Index Weights combined with the Capped Component Index Weights. 
If the Allocation Advisor has elected to provide a Target Portfolio to the Investment Manager 
as Allocation Advice, the Allocation Advisor will determine the Target Portfolio Weights. The 
Target Portfolio Weights are comprised of the Market Beta Index Weights combined with 
the Tactical Commodity Target Weights. The Investment Manager will then derive the 
Capped Component Index Weights based on such Tactical Commodity Target Weights to 
determine the Model and Model Portfolio Weights. Otherwise, the Allocation Advisor will 
determine and communicate the Model Portfolio Weights (together with the Model Portfolio) 
to the Investment Manager as Allocation Advice. 
vi.  
Discretionary Allocation: The Allocation Advisor combines quantitative and qualitative 
criteria in selecting Eligible Indices, determining the Commodity Market Beta Index Weights 
and the Tactical Commodity Target Weights. This Asset Allocation Process entails certain 
discretionary elements; however, the weight limits set out in the Asset Allocation process 
and the Allocation Guidelines impose strict limits in terms of exposure.

Allocation Guidelines 
 
The Allocation Guidelines set out below are applied as part of the Asset Allocation Process. Please 
 see Overview of Asset Allocation Process for more information. 
(i) 
Subcategories of the same commodity (for example WTI crude, Brent crude, gasoline 
and heating oil) are considered as being the same commodity, provided they are 
highly correlated. Subcategories of the same commodity are considered highly 
correlated where 25 per cent of the correlation observations are above 0.8. The 
maximum total of any negative and positive weights (on a net basis) to each 
commodity will be 20% of each of the Target Portfolio and the Portfolio, with the 
exception that one commodity at any given time can have a maximum total 35% each 
of the Target Portfolio and the Portfolio. 
 
 (E) Eligible Tactical Commodities:  
Exposure to Eligible Tactical Commodities will be achieved via the Commodity Capped Component 
Indices. The Eligible Tactical Commodities are the underlying components of the Commodity 
Capped Component Indices, which are commodity futures contracts in the commodities listed 
below: 
 
WTI Crude 
Brent Crude 
Heating Oil 
Gas Oil

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD READ AND 
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT IN THE PROSPECTUS AND THOSE SET OUT 
BELOW BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE FUND. THESE RISK FACTORS 
MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. In particular, 
no financial instrument enables the returns of any Index to be reproduced or tracked 
exactly. Changes in the investments of any Fund and re-weightings of the relevant 
Index may give rise to various transaction costs (including in relation to the settlement 
of foreign currency transactions), operating expenses or inefficiencies which may 
adversely impact a Fund's tracking of the performance of an Index. Furthermore, the 
total return on investment will be reduced by certain costs and expenses which are not 
taken into account in the calculation of the applicable Index. Moreover, in the event of 
a temporary suspension or interruption of trading in the investments comprising any 
Index, or of market disruptions, re-balancing the Fund's investment portfolio may not 
be possible and may result in deviations from the return of the Index. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors” sub-section “Use of Derivatives” 
in the Prospectus. 
 
(f) 
The commodity asset class tends to have higher volatility and downside risk compared 
to traditional asset classes like bonds and equities. In addition, as the Underlying is 
composed of commodity indices, the Fund will be less diversified than a fund investing 
in a broader range of asset classes, and is therefore likely to be more volatile. 
 
(g) 
Commodities prices are affected by liquidity, supply and demand, market activity, 
regulatory intervention, civil action, embargoes, tariffs, natural disasters and other 
geopolitical circumstances and international economic developments. These factors 
interrelate in complex ways, and the effect of one of the factors on the market value of 
any Index and/ or the Fund Assets may offset or enhance the effect of another factor. 
This may affect the value of any Index, the Fund Assets, and consequently, the Net 
Asset Value per Share. 
 
(h) 
Trading in futures contracts on underlying commodities, including the underlying 
components of the Indices, is speculative and can be extremely volatile. Market prices 
of underlying components may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: 
change in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, 
unanticipated or unrealised); weather; agriculture; trade; fiscal, monetary and 
exchange control programmes; domestic and foreign political and economic events 

 <Page227>  
 
227 
 
and policies; disease; pestilence; technological developments; change in interest rates, 
whether through governmental action or market movements; and monetary and other 
governmental policies; action or inaction. The current or “spot” prices of the underlying 
commodities may also affect, in a volatile and inconsistent manner, the price of futures 
contracts in respect of the relevant commodity. Different factors may cause the prices 
of the Index or any underlying component and the volatilities of the prices to move in 
inconsistent directions and at inconsistent rates. These factors may affect the value of 
the Index, and consequently, the value of Fund Assets and therefore of the Fund, in 
varying ways. 
 
(i) 
The prices of commodities, including those underlying the Indices, can fluctuate widely 
due to supply and demand disruptions in major producing or consuming regions. In 
particular, recent growth in industrial production and gross domestic product has made 
China an oversized user of commodities and has increased the extent to which certain 
commodities rely on Chinese demand. Political, economic and other developments 
that affect China may affect the value of the commodities underlying the Index or any 
underlying component, and may consequently affect the value of the Fund. Because 
certain commodities underlying the Index may be produced in a limited number of 
countries and may be controlled by a small number of producers, political, economic 
and supply related events in such countries could have a disproportionate impact on 
the prices of such commodities and the value of the Index, and consequently, the value 
of the Fund. 
 
(j) 
The value of the Indices could be adversely affected by the promulgation of new laws 
or regulations or by the reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations (including, 
without limitation, those relating to taxes and duties on any commodity index) by one 
or more governments, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, courts or other 
official bodies. Such changes may affect the value of the Fund Assets, and 
consequently of the Fund, and may lead to a Disruption Event. 
 
(k) 
Commodity prices may reference illiquid futures contracts. The prices for such futures 
may differ significantly from spot prices for the same commodity. 
 
(l) 
Commodity markets are subject to frequent disruptions and temporary distortions due 
to various factors, including lack of liquidity in the markets, the participation of 
speculators and government regulation or intervention. The effects of market 
dislocation can be global, regardless of the locality of the disruption. This may trigger 
disruption events and adjustments in respect of the value of the Index and Fund Assets; 
and consequently affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(m) 
Certain futures contracts included in the Indices or any underlying component may, 
from time to time, be traded on the London Metal Exchange (the “LME”) and not on a 
US futures exchange. Some US commodity exchanges have regulations that limit the 
amount of fluctuation in some futures contract prices that may occur during a single 
business day. In contrast, LME has no such daily price fluctuation limits to restrict the 
extent of daily fluctuations in prices of declining market, therefore it is possible that the 
process for one or more contracts traded on the LME, including those included 
amongst underlying components of the Indices, would continue to decline without 
limitation within a trading day or over a period of trading days. A steep decline of such 
underlying component, if any, could have a significant adverse impact on the value of 
the Index, and will consequently affect the value of the Fund. 
 
(n) 
Certain types of assets may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market conditions, 
and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(o) 
Exposure to the Underlying is achieved through an investment in the Swaps. Given the 
nature of the Swaps and the costs that may be involved in their utilisation, the value of 

 <Page228>  
 
228 
 
the Swaps (which ultimately determine the return the Shareholders will receive) may 
not exactly track the value of the Underlying. Shareholders should thus be familiar with 
the risks associated with such an approach to investment. 
 
(p) 
Under the terms of the Swaps, the Approved Counterparty has discretion not to 
execute a request from the Company on behalf of the Fund to increase exposure under 
the Swaps, and therefore not to invest net proceeds of any issue of Shares (whether 
on the Launch Date or subsequently) into the Swaps. Under such circumstances, the 
Fund will not be able to gain exposure to the Underlying to the extent that such 
subscription proceeds are not invested in Swaps, until such time as the Approved 
Counterparty is able to accept further investments into the Swaps. 
 
(q) 
The Swaps may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon the occurrence of 
certain events with respect to either the Approved Counterparty or the Fund (including 
change in law, hedging disruption, increased cost of hedging, termination of or material 
change to the applicable rules to a given Index, failure to pay, insolvency and the 
imposition of withholding tax on the payments due by either party). Upon such 
termination, the Fund or the Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a 
termination payment (regardless of which party may have caused such termination) 
based on the mark to market value of the Swaps at such time, as determined by the 
Approved Counterparty. 
 
(r) 
The value of the Swaps may be adjusted by the Approved Counterparty or the 
Calculation Agent in accordance with their terms, in response to disruption events 
affecting such Swaps or the Underlying; or in response to modification or termination 
of the Index to which they reference. Whilst it is expected that such adjustments will 
be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, such adjustments 
may affect the value of Fund Assets, and consequently, the Net Asset Value of Shares. 
 
(s) 
The return payable under the Swaps may be subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank 
PLC as an Approved Counterparty. In addition, different business areas within the 
investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, will act as the Calculation Agent 
under the Swaps and Index Sponsor. Shareholders should note that not only will they 
be exposed to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC but also potential conflicts of 
interest in the performance of these functions by Barclays Bank PLC. In such 
circumstances, Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to use its reasonable endeavours 
to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to its respective obligations 
and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the Company and the Shareholders are 
not unfairly prejudiced. The Directors believe that Barclays Bank PLC is suitable and 
competent to perform such functions. 
 
(t) 
Potential conflicts of interest may exist in the internal teams and divisions within 
Barclays Bank PLC and therefore in the course of normal business operations of the 
Index Sponsor and other divisions and teams of Barclays Bank PLC and/or any of its 
affiliates. During the course of normal business operations, the Index Sponsor may 
determine, calculate and publish the Indices, while another team within Barclays Bank 
PLC may issue, enter into, promote, offer or sell transactions or investments linked, in 
whole or in part, to the Index. In addition, another team within Barclays Bank PLC may 
have, or may have had, interests or positions, or may buy, sell or otherwise trade 
positions in or relating to the underlying assets linked to the Index. Such activities may 
or may not have an impact on the level of the Index. In view of the different roles 
performed by Barclays Bank PLC through the various teams, Barclays Bank PLC as 
an entity is subject to potential conflicts of interests. 
 
(u) 
While the Index Sponsor currently employs the methodology ascribed to the Index (and 
application of such methodology shall be conclusive and binding), no assurance can 
be given that market, regulatory, juridical, financial, fiscal or other circumstances 

 <Page229>  
 
229 
 
(including, but not limited to, any changes to or any suspension or termination of or 
any other events affecting any constituent within the Index) will not arise that would, in 
the view of the Index Sponsor, necessitate an adjustment, modification or change of 
such methodology. The Index Sponsor may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, at 
any time and without notice, adjust, suspend or terminate the Index. The Index Sponsor 
is also under no obligation to continue the calculation, publication and dissemination 
of the Index. Any such adjustment, suspension, termination or non-publication may 
have a negative impact on the Swaps and consequently, also on the Fund. 
 
Some Indices may be only recently established and therefore have no history to 
evaluate its likely performance. 
 
The Indices are not intended to predict actual results and no assurances are given with 
respect thereto. 
 
The Indices are subject to certain extraordinary and force majeure events, including, 
but not limited to, any modification to, or cancellation of, the Index or any elimination 
or exchange of any index component or constituent, the consequences of which may 
have a negative impact upon the performance of the Index. 
 
In the case of any ambiguities arising in the Index methodologies, the Index Sponsor 
will resolve such ambiguities in good faith and in a reasonable manner and, if 
necessary, amend the relevant Index Methodology Description to reflect such 
resolution. 
 
(v) 
While the Allocation Advisor will use robust quantitative models, no assurance can be 
given that market, regulatory, juridical, financial, fiscal or any other circumstances will 
not arise that would, in the view of the Allocation Advisor, necessitate an adjustment, 
 modification or change of such models.  
(w) 
The sub-funds of the Company are segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as 
such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the 
liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be noted that the Company is a single 
legal entity which may operate or have assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims 
in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily recognise such segregation. There can 
be no guarantee that the courts of any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the 
limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
(x) 
The Fund may seek to hedge the exchange rate translation risk for each Class of 
Shares not denominated in the Base Currency by notionally entering into an 
appropriate FX forward contract (the “FX Forward”). Should such hedging be 
undertaken, the notional amount of the FX Forward will be fixed at the beginning of 
each relevant FX Forward contract based on the latest available value of the Net Asset 
Value for the relevant Classes of Shares at such date. Any subsequent movement in 
the value of the Underlying will result in a portion of the exposure to the Underlying 
equal in value to that movement being unhedged against foreign exchange translation 
risk until the date on which the FX Forwards are rolled for the following period or until 
any subsequent trades are executed at the discretion of the Investment Manager. The 
value of the Shares may also be affected by fluctuations in value due to the change in 
mark-to-market value of the FX Forwards. 
 
(y) 
As the investment exposure gained by the Fund is synthetic, the Fund will have no 
rights with respect to the underlying components comprised in the Indices. Entering 
into financial derivative instruments such as the Swaps will not make the Fund a holder 
of, or give the Fund a direct investment position in, any of the Underlying or the Indices 
or any component included therein. Any amounts payable under the Swaps will be 
made in cash and the Fund will not have any rights to receive delivery of any Underlying 

 <Page230>  
 
230 
 
or any component included therein. Similarly, an investment in the Fund will therefore 
not make the investor a holder of, or give an investor a direct investment position in, 
any of the Underlying or the Indices or any component included therein. Any amounts 
payable in respect of Shares will be made in cash and investors will not have any rights 
to receive delivery of any Underlying or Indices or any component included therein. 
 
(z) 
The commodities and mineral sectors are becoming increasingly regulated due to the 
increase in the sensitization of human rights abuses and sustainability risks specific to 
these sectors. These risks can range from child labour, lack of health and safety 
protocols and mineral sourcing in conflict and high risk areas. With the increase in due 
diligence regulatory requirements throughout the commodities and minerals supply 
chains, companies may be faced with legal liability risks and reputational risks if 
appropriate due diligence and traceability mechanisms are not implemented and 
monitored, which may undermine the value of the underlyings. In relation to a Fund, it 
may be invested in commodity indices, as well as individual stocks. These events could 
 therefore have an impact on the return of the Fund. 
(aa) 
In addition, the energy sector is known as a major Greenhouse Gas (GHG) producer 
and may be subject to greater regulatory or public pressure than other sectors and 
thus, greater sustainability risk. Moreover, many of the energy companies assets may 
take place in complex operating environments and/or remote countries where 
governance risks might be more pronounced and where various incidents (e.g. spills 
and leaks) may occur. In addition, attempts by companies to adapt so as to reduce 
their impact on sustainability factors may not be successful, may result in significant 
costs being incurred, and future ongoing profitability on the company may be materially 
reduced.

 <Page237>  
 
237 
 
(iii) 
any suspension of or limitation imposed on trading by the Relevant Exchanges, 
or otherwise and whether by reason of movements in price exceeding limits 
permitted by such Relevant Exchange or otherwise: (1) relating to any

(2) in futures or options contracts relating to the Index, the S&P 500® Index or 
 any of their components on any Relevant Exchange; and 
(iv) 
the closure on any exchange business day of any Relevant Exchanges for the 
S&P 500® Index or any of its component securities or any futures or options 
relating to the S&P 500® Index prior to its scheduled closing time (“Early 
Closure”). 
 
 Swaps means Unfunded Swaps and Funded Swaps. 
Tracking Error means the standard deviation of the difference in return between the Fund and the 
 Index. 
Unfunded Swap means a swap, including TRS and excess return swaps, entered into with an 
Approved Counterparty under which the Approved Counterparty will pay to the Fund the 
performance of an underlying asset (net of any costs), if positive, and the Fund will pay to the 
Approved Counterparty the absolute value of the performance of the underlying asset if negative 
 (net of any costs). No upfront payment is made by the Fund. 
Variance Swap(s) means an over-the-counter fixed-term Unfunded Swap which has a payoff that 
is equivalent to the difference between the squares of the Realised Volatility (“Variance”) of a 
reference asset and the Strike Level multiplied by a pre-agreed notional amount. A short position 
in a Variance Swap has a negative payoff if the Realised Volatility of the reference asset is greater 
 than the Strike Level. The payoff of Variance Swaps can be replicated using options.  
Vega is the rate of change of value of a financial instrument with respect to changes in volatility.

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The investment objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with a return linked to the 
performance of the Short Variance Strategy via the Index, as further described in the section 
 “General Description of the Underlying”. 
The Shareholders will receive the performance of the Index net of fees and expenses as further 
described under “Fees and Expenses” below. Therefore, the return Shareholders may receive 
may not wholly correspond to the performance of the Index, as more particularly described in the 
Prospectus. Additionally, the return Shareholders may receive may not correspond to the 
performance of the Index under certain exceptional circumstances such as disruptive market 
conditions (notably following the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, Swap Disruption Event 
or a temporary suspension or interruption of trading in the components comprising the Index), 
 extremely volatile markets or liquidity or trading constraints.  
The Fund is actively managed and uses the S&P 500® Index (the “Benchmark”) by seeking indirect 
exposure to its volatility through the Variance Swap Strategy. Although the Fund is indirectly 
exposed to the Benchmark and all of its constituents, its performance may materially deviate from 
 the one of the Benchmark given its strategy. 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the investment objective or pay any 
 dividends. The Fund is not capital protected nor is it guaranteed. 
 Investment Policy and Fund Assets 
In order to achieve the investment objective, the Fund shall invest in Fund Assets, including Funded 
Swaps and Unfunded Swaps on the Index with the Approved Counterparty. The Index follows the 
 Short Variance Strategy, as further described in the “General Description of the Underlying”. 
Where the Fund enters into Unfunded Swaps, it may invest any remaining cash in Money Market 
Instruments or fixed income instruments. The Fund shall enter into such Swaps, Money Market 
Instruments and fixed income investments at the discretion of the Investment Manager. Swaps 
 entered into by the Fund are more fully described under “Use of FDIs”. 
The Fund may also invest in FDIs as further described under “Efficient Portfolio Management” 
 below, and may also hold ancillary cash positions in various currencies. 
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor seeking exposure to the performance of the Short Variance 
 Strategy as further described in “General Description of the Underlying”. 
 Valuation 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day in order to determine 
 the Net Asset Value of the Fund in accordance with the rules set out in the Prospectus. 
Further information relevant to the Fund’s investment policy is contained in the main part of the 
   Prospectus under “Investment Objectives and Policies” and under “Investment Restrictions”. 

 <Page239>  
 
239 
 
 Investment Restrictions 
The Fund will not invest more than 10% of its net assets in units of other UCITS or other Collective 
 Investment Schemes. 
Subject to the above, the general investment restrictions set out under "Funds – Investment 
 Restrictions" in the Prospectus apply to the Fund. 
 Tracking Difference/Tracking Error 
Investment in the Fund should not be considered to provide a direct investment in the Index, as the 
Fund gains exposure to the Index via an Unfunded Swap (or Funded Swap), and the Fund will not 
invest directly in components of the Index. In normal market conditions, the Fund can be expected 
to match the performance of the Index (less fees and associated costs as further described under 
 “Transaction Fees” and “Fees and Expenses” below). 
Tracking Error should be differentiated from the tracking difference, which is simply the difference 
between the return of the Fund and the return of the Index, over a given period of time (the 
“Tracking Difference”). The Tracking Difference indicates the extent to which a Fund has 
outperformed or underperformed the Index. In contrast, the Tracking Error measures how 
consistently the Fund return matches the Index. Hence, while the Tracking Difference shows how 
a Fund’s performance compares with that of the Index over a given period of time, the Tracking 
 Error indicates the consistency of the difference of return during this same period of time. 
 Leverage 
 The Fund will not be leveraged for the purpose of investment. 
The Company employs an absolute value-at-risk (Absolute VaR) based approach as part of its risk 
management process which enables it to accurately measure, monitor and manage the various 
risks associated with the Swaps used by the Fund. The Fund’s VaR is limited by an absolute VaR 
calculated on the basis of the net asset value of the Fund and not exceeding a maximum VaR limit 
determined by the Company taking into account the investment policy and the risk profile of the 
Fund. The maximum internal VaR limit is set at 8%. The use of Swaps by the Fund should result 
in the Fund having the volatility characteristics of the Short Variance Strategy. Upon request, the 
Company may provide supplementary information to Shareholders relating to the risk management 
 methods employed, including the quantitative limits that are applied. 
 The Fund will not borrow for investment purposes. 
 Subscriptions and Redemptions 
The Fund will only be open to subscriptions and redemptions on Dealing Days, each being a 
 Rebalancing Date. As a result, the Fund will only have weekly liquidity. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
 will be done in cash or in specie in compliance with the Articles. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; and (c) dealing charges, taxes 
 and other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets.

The examples shown in the table assume that the Fund holds only Swaps and ancillary cash and 
is collateralised to the extent required by the Law, and is receiving the performance of the Index 
pursuant to the Swaps (see “Use of Derivative Contract” below). It also assumes a constant 
investment with no additional subscriptions or redemptions in the Fund and without deduction of 
 any fees or expenses. 
 Use of FDIs 
 The Fund may gain exposure to the Index through Swaps. 
The Fund may also use FDIs (including futures, forwards, options and/or Swaps) for efficient 
portfolio management purposes, as further detailed under “Currency Hedging”, and used to hedge 
 the exposure of the Fund to interest rates, equities, currencies and other risks. 
The Approved Counterparty to the FDIs will be required to provide collateral to the Company so 
that the Company's risk exposure to the Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent required 
by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
 Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs will have a fixed maturity and may also be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events 
with respect to either the Fund or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event 
of default (such as a failure to pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event 
(which is not the fault of either party, for example, illegality or a tax event) or a Disruption Event. In 
each case the FDI will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter 
into new FDIs with other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the financial asset 
 classes. 
The Management Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with 
the CSSF. Any investment in FDIs will be made in accordance with this risk management 
policy. The Management Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative 
limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of 
 the main categories of investments. 
Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that, with the advice of the Investment Manager, 
   the Fund uses TRS in order to gain exposure to all or part of the Index.  

 <Page241>

The expected and maximum proportion of the total assets which may be subject to Swaps is 
summarized in the table below. In certain circumstances this proportion may be higher.

 Automatic Termination of the Fund 
Under the terms of the Swaps providing exposure to the Index, the Approved Counterparty has the 
right to terminate the Swap on the Rebalancing Date. In addition, if the Index Level of the Index 
falls to zero, the Swap on such Index will also be terminated. Upon such event, the Fund may be 
invested in Money Market Instruments and may also hold ancillary cash positions, whilst the 
Investment Manager seeks to identify a suitable replacement Swap. If no suitable replacement can 
be found in order to achieve the Investment Objective of the Fund, the Fund will be terminated 
 automatically within one month from the date of notice of termination. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to the 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(i) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and 
in good faith, make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund 
Assets and/or any constituents thereof. The Net Asset Value may be 
affected by such adjustment; and/or 
 
(ii) 
the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset 
Value and any subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in 
accordance with the provisions of the Prospectus under the section 
“Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value”; and/or 
 
(iii) 
the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as 
set out in the Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
    

 <Page242>

 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will be entitled to look solely to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and the Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds of 
all claims of the Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the 
Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such 
claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically 
extinguished, (b) the Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof 
and (c) the Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company 
 as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
 Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. 
 Dividend Policy 
 There are no dividends in respect of any Class of Shares.

1 For the avoidance of doubt, whilst no specific limitations on redemptions exist, investors should 
be aware of the Fund’s general ability to apply a 10% limitation on redemptions of shares on each 
Dealing Day (please see section “Limitations on Repurchases” of the Prospectus for a more 
 detailed explanation of the gating mechanism). 
2 The Board of Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, may decide to hard close 
all the Share Classes to subscriptions from investors in the event that the capacity limit of the Index, 
as determined from time to time by the Investment Manager, is reached. The capacity limit is the 
maximum size for the Index to be efficiently managed by the Index Sponsor. The Board of Directors, 
in consultation with the Investment Manager, may decide (in its sole and absolute discretion) to re-
open the subscriptions in all Share Classes in the event that the capacity permits so. Decisions 
taken by the Board of Directors on the closure and re-opening may have immediate or non-
immediate effect and may be effective for an unspecified period of time. In relation thereto, 
information on the closure and re-opening of these Share Classes will be available at the registered 
 office of the Company. 
3 The Board of Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, may decide to hard close 
Share Classes E, E1, F, F1, G, G1, H and H1 to subscriptions from investors in the event that the 
capacity limit of these Share Classes, as determined from time to time by the Investment Manager, 
is reached. The capacity limit is the maximum aggregate size for Share Classes E, E1, F, F1, G, 
G1, H and H1, at which, in the opinion of the Investment Manager, those Share Classes can no 
longer be operated in an economically efficient manner. Such maximum size shall not be less than 
USD 30 million. The Board of Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, may decide 
(in its sole and absolute discretion) to re-open the subscriptions at any time each time the Share 
Classes capacity permits so. Decisions taken by the Board of Directors on the closure and re-

period of time. In relation thereto, information on the closure and re-opening of these Share Classes 
 will be available at the registered office of the Company

1In accordance with and subject to the terms of the Management Company Agreement, the annual 
Management Fees, represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value (plus VAT, if any) of the 
relevant Share Class, subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1,250 EUR per Fund. Management 
Fees are payable periodically at a rate which is within the range specified above. The Management 
Fee will be calculated upon each Dealing Day. Fees payable to the Investment Manager or 
Distributor (other than the Preliminary Charge) or Sub-Distributor, will be payable out of the 
Management Fee. The Management Company may instruct the Company to pay any such fees 
payable to the Investment Manager, or Distributor or Sub-Distributor, directly out of the assets of 
the Company. In such case, the portion of the Management Fee due to the Management Company 
will be reduced accordingly. Neither the Investment Manager nor the Distributor or Sub Distributor 
will be entitled to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their respective out-of-pocket 
 expenses. 
2 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share Class is payable by the Company for 
the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Fees of Management Fees, Extraordinary 
Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. Additionally, the Fixed 
Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as 
disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of doubt, please note 
 that Transaction Fees (as defined in the Prospectus) are excluded from Fixed Fees. 
 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees shall mean any costs in respect of buying and selling any of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, trading and administrative costs of entering into FDIs, transactional 
charges, collateral costs, brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads and licensing fees. 
The Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund will be calculated net of such costs, which may affect 
 the performance of the Fund.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING 
 
 
(A) 
Overview 
 
The Index tracks the Short Variance Strategy. The Short Variance Strategy notionally sells on each 
weekly Rebalancing Date one-week Variance Swaps, as described below in “The Short Variance 
 Strategy”.  
The Strike Level of each Variance Swap is based on Implied Volatility, which is calculated as 
described below in “The Short Variance Strategy Description”. When the Short Variance 
Strategy notionally enters into a new weekly Variance Swap, it incurs notional costs based on the 
Implied Volatility, designed to reflect a bid-offer in respect of the Variance Swap and a gap risk cost 
arising from the flooring of the Index Level at zero. These notional costs reduce the Index Level, 
 and are thereby also incurred by and passed down to the investors. 
(B) 
The Short Variance Strategy 
 
The Short Variance Strategy is an equity-linked volatility strategy that rolls short positions on weekly 
Variance Swaps. The Short Variance Strategy measures the profit and loss from selling weekly 
Variance Swaps on the S&P 500® Index at maturity. The weekly Variance Swap has returns floored 
 at -100%.  
Variance Swaps on the S&P 500® Index are fixed-term Unfunded Swaps which have a payoff that 
is equivalent to the difference between the squares of the Realised Volatility (or “Variance”) of the 
S&P 500® Index and the Strike Level multiplied by a pre-agreed notional amount. The Strike Level 
is based on the Implied Volatility of the S&P 500® Index calculated based on the VIX® Methodology. 
A short position in a Variance Swap has a positive payoff if the Realised Volatility is lower than the 
 Strike Level. 
(C) 
The Short Variance Strategy Description 
 
1. Sell a Variance Swap on a weekly basis with parameters determined as follows: 
 
(i) 
Strike Level 
The Short Variance Strategy sells a Variance Swap on the S&P 500® Index with a 
specific Strike Level each week. To determine the Strike Level on the Rebalancing 
Date, the Short Variance Strategy first calculates the Implied Volatility, which is 
calculated based on the VIX® Methodology applied to listed options on the S&P 
500® Index expiring at the same time as the Variance Swap. On Rebalancing 
Dates, the Implied Volatility used to calculate the Strike Level is capped at a ratio 
of 1.6 times the Implied Volatility of the At-The-Money Options on the S&P 500® 
 Index. 
The Implied Volatility is then adjusted for day count convention from calendar days 
to business days. The Strike Level is calculated by subtracting (i) a formulaic 
amount, dependent on the level of Implied Volatility, designed to reflect a bid-offer 
cost in respect of the Variance Swap, and (ii) a formulaic amount, also dependent 
on the level of Implied Volatility, designed to reflect the cost of flooring the Index 
 Level at zero (together the “Index Embedded Costs”). 
(ii) 
Swap Notional based on Vega 
The Short Variance Strategy sells a Variance Swap on the S&P 500® Index with 
maturity of one week and a principal notional amount required to achieve a short 
Vega (as defined in the definition above) position of up to 0.075%. This means that 

 <Page248>  
 
248 
 
if the difference between the Strike Level and Realised Volatility is 1%, the strategy 
performance should be approximately 0.075%. The strategy performance depends 
approximately linearly on the difference between the Strike Level and Realised 
Volatility only when such differences are small. For large differences, the strategy 
performance has a convex return profile. This means the strategy may sustain 
large losses during large market moves that result in high Realised Volatility. The 
Vega achieved every week is calibrated such that a Realised Volatility of either 
135% or 10 times the Strike Level in such week would cause the Index Level to go 
to zero, subject to maximum Vega of 0.075%. In times of high and low volatility, 
 the Short Variance Strategy deleverages by lowering the Vega achieved. 
(iii) 
Floor the Swap payoff at -100% 
The Short Variance Strategy reflects the profit or loss from selling a Variance Swap 
on the S&P 500® Index. The Variance Swap return over the week is floored at -
100%. The level of the Index tracking the Short Variance Strategy will therefore 
 not go below zero.  
2. Calculate Realised Volatility over the past week 
Realised Volatility of the S&P 500® Index based on hourly returns tends to be lower that 
Realised Volatility based on daily returns. Realised Volatility over the week is calculated 
using the hourly returns of the S&P 500® Index in order to enhance returns from selling a 
 Variance Swap on the S&P 500® Index. 
3. Settle the Variance Swap Returns 
After one week, i.e. at maturity, the Variance Swap will terminate and the performance of 
such Variance Swap will be reflected in the rebalancing of the Index Level. On the maturity 
date, the Short Variance Strategy sells a new Variance Swap on the S&P 500® Index, 
 repeating the above processes. 
(D) 
The Index 
 
 The Index is a financial index which tracks the Short Variance Strategy, 
• 
The Index has a weekly rebalancing frequency (i.e. on Fridays) and not an intra-day or a 
daily rebalancing. I 
 
• 
The Index Sponsor will make available information on the Index on its website (see links 
below). Such information will include (a) the Index Level in respect of each Index Business 
Day, (b) the composition of the Index, and (c) the corresponding weight of each component 
of the Index. This information will be made available as soon as reasonably practicable on 
or after each such Index Business Day on the Index Sponsor’s website: 
https://indices.barclays/IM/21/en/indices/details.app;ticker=BXIISWF7 (or any successor 
thereto). The Index Sponsor will also make available (i) the Index Methodology Description, 
setting out a full description of the set of rules governing the underlying methodology, 
calculation and publication of the Index, which includes the formula for the determination 
of the Index Embedded Costs, and (ii) historical impact of the Index Embedded Costs on 
the performance of the Index, calculated by the Index Sponsor, each on the Index 
Sponsor’s website: https://indices.barclays/wsvfimd (or any successor thereto).

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD READ AND 
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT IN THE PROSPECTUS AND THOSE SET OUT 
BELOW BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE FUND. THESE RISK FACTORS 
MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. In particular, 
no financial instrument enables the returns of the Index to be reproduced or tracked 
exactly. Changes in the investments of any Fund and re-weightings of the Index may 
give rise to various transaction costs (including in relation to the settlement of foreign 
currency transactions), operating expenses or inefficiencies which may adversely 
impact a Fund's tracking of the performance of the Index. Furthermore, the total return 
on investment will be reduced by certain costs and expenses which are not taken into 
account in the calculation of the Index. Moreover, in the event of a temporary 
suspension or interruption of trading in the investments comprising the Index, or of 
market disruptions, re-balancing the Fund's investment portfolio may not be possible 
and may result in deviations from the return of the Index. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors” sub-section “Use of Derivatives” 
in the Prospectus. 
 
(f) 
Variance Swaps have a convex payoff profile, which means the Index may have large 
losses during large market moves that result in a high realised volatility. Short variance 
strategies generally experienced sizeable drawdowns during the high realised volatility 
period in Fall 2008; however, the returns of this Index do not capture this period.  
 
(g) 
Variance Swaps have significant market exposure (“variance swap delta”) which stems 
from the fact that realised volatility is usually negatively correlated with market returns.  
 
(h) 
The Variance Swap Strike Level used within the strategy is not necessarily equivalent 
to the variance swap strike level that an investor could execute at the prevailing time. 
As a consequence, the Index Embedded Costs may be lower or higher than the actual 
costs incurred by an investor. 
 
(i) 
The value of the Index could be adversely affected by the promulgation of new laws or 
regulations or by the reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations (including, without 
limitation, those relating to taxes and duties on any equity index) by one or more 
governments, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, courts or other official 
bodies. Such changes may affect the value of the Fund Assets, and consequently of 
the Fund, and may lead to a Disruption Event. 

 <Page250>  
 
250 
 
 
(j) 
Certain types of assets may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market conditions, 
and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(k) 
Exposure to the Short Variance Strategy is achieved through an investment in the 
Swaps on the Index. Given the nature of the Swaps and the costs that may be involved 
in their utilisation, the value of the Swaps (which ultimately determine the return the 
Shareholders will receive) may not exactly track the value of the Index. Shareholders 
should thus be familiar with the risks associated with such an approach to investment. 
 
(l) 
Under the terms of the Swaps, the Approved Counterparty has discretion not to 
execute a request from the Company on behalf of the Fund to increase exposure under 
the Swaps, and therefore not to invest net proceeds of any issue of Shares (whether 
on the Launch Date or subsequently) into the Swaps. Under such circumstances, the 
Fund will not be able to gain exposure to the Underlying to the extent that such 
subscription proceeds are not invested in Swaps, until such time as the Approved 
Counterparty is able to accept further investments into the Swaps. 
 
(m) 
The Swaps may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon the occurrence of 
certain events with respect to either the Approved Counterparty or the Fund (including 
change in law, hedging disruption, increased cost of hedging, termination of or material 
change to the applicable rules to the Index, failure to pay, insolvency and the imposition 
of withholding tax on the payments due by either party). Upon such termination, the 
Fund or the Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment 
(regardless of which party may have caused such termination) based on the mark to 
market value of the Swaps at such time, as determined by the Approved Counterparty. 
 
(n) 
The value of the Swaps may be adjusted by the Approved Counterparty or the 
Calculation Agent in accordance with their terms, in response to disruption events 
affecting such Swaps or the Underlying; or in response to modification or termination 
of the Index. Whilst it is expected that such adjustments will be made in good faith and 
in a commercially reasonable manner, such adjustments may affect the value of Fund 
Assets, and consequently, the Net Asset Value of Shares. 
 
(o) 
Due to the weekly liquidity of the Fund, the Shareholders will not be able to redeem 
their investments on days other than the weekly Rebalancing Dates, potentially leaving 
Shareholders exposed to negative performance incurred in periods between 
 Rebalancing Dates. 
(p) 
The return payable under the Swaps may be subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank 
PLC as an Approved Counterparty. In addition, different business areas within the 
investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, will act as the Calculation Agent 
under the Swaps and Index Sponsor. Shareholders should note that not only will they 
be exposed to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC but also potential conflicts of 
interest in the performance of these functions by Barclays Bank PLC. In such 
circumstances, Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to use its reasonable endeavours 
to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to its respective obligations 
and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the Company and the Shareholders are 
not unfairly prejudiced. The Directors believe that Barclays Bank PLC is suitable and 
competent to perform such functions. 
 
(q) 
Potential conflicts of interest may exist in the internal teams and divisions within 
Barclays Bank PLC and therefore in the course of normal business operations of the 
Index Sponsor and other divisions and teams of Barclays Bank PLC and/or any of its 
affiliates. During the course of normal business operations, the Index Sponsor may 
determine, calculate and publish the Index, while another team within Barclays Bank 
PLC may issue, enter into, promote, offer or sell transactions or investments linked, in 
whole or in part, to the Index. In addition, another team within Barclays Bank PLC may 

 <Page251>  
 
251 
 
have, or may have had, interests or positions, or may buy, sell or otherwise trade 
positions in or relating to the underlying assets linked to the Index. Such activities may 
or may not have an impact on the level of the Index. In view of the different roles 
performed by Barclays Bank PLC through the various teams, Barclays Bank PLC as 
an entity is subject to potential conflicts of interests. 
 
(r) 
While the Index Sponsor currently employs the methodology ascribed to the Index (and 
application of such methodology shall be conclusive and binding), no assurance can 
be given that market, regulatory, juridical, financial, fiscal or other circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, any changes to or any suspension or termination of or 
any other events affecting any constituent within the Index) will not arise that would, in 
the view of the Index Sponsor, necessitate an adjustment, modification or change of 
such methodology. The Index Sponsor may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, at 
any time and without notice, adjust, suspend or terminate the Index. The Index Sponsor 
is also under no obligation to continue the calculation, publication and dissemination 
of the Index. Any such adjustment, suspension, termination or non-publication may 
have a negative impact on the Swaps and consequently, also on the Fund. 
 
The Index may have been only recently established and therefore may have no history 
to evaluate its likely performance. 
 
The Index is not intended to predict actual results and no assurances are given with 
respect thereto. 
 
The Index is subject to certain extraordinary and force majeure events, including, but 
not limited to, any modification to, or cancellation of, the Index or any elimination or 
exchange of any index component or constituent, the consequences of which may 
have a negative impact upon the performance of the Index. 
 
In the case of any ambiguities arising in the Index Rules, the Index Sponsor will resolve 
such ambiguities in good faith and in a reasonable manner and, if necessary, amend 
 the Index Rules to reflect such resolution. 
(s) 
The sub-funds of the Company are segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as 
such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the 
liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be noted that the Company is a single 
legal entity which may operate or have assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims 
in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily recognise such segregation. There can 
be no guarantee that the courts of any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the 
limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
(t) 
The Fund may seek to hedge the exchange rate translation risk for each Class of 
Shares not denominated in the Base Currency by notionally entering into an 
appropriate FX forward contract (the “FX Forward”). Should such hedging be 
undertaken, the notional amount of the FX Forward will be fixed at the beginning of 
each relevant FX Forward contract based on the latest available value of the Net Asset 
Value for the relevant Classes of Shares at such date. Any subsequent movement in 
the value of the Underlying will result in a portion of the exposure to the Underlying 
equal in value to that movement being unhedged against foreign exchange translation 
risk until the date on which the FX Forwards are rolled for the following period or until 
any subsequent trades are executed at the discretion of the Investment Manager. The 
value of the Shares may also be affected by fluctuations in value due to the change in 
mark-to-market value of the FX Forwards. 
 
(u) 
As the investment exposure gained by the Fund is synthetic, the Fund will have no 
rights with respect to the underlying components comprised in the Index. Entering into 
financial derivative instruments such as the Swaps will not make the Fund a holder of, 
or give the Fund a direct investment position in, the Index or any component included 

 <Page252>  
 
252 
 
therein. Any amounts payable under the Swaps will be made in cash and the Fund will 
not have any rights to receive delivery of any Underlying or any component included 
therein. Similarly, an investment in the Fund will therefore not make the investor a 
holder of, or give an investor a direct investment position in, the Index or any 
component included therein. Any amounts payable in respect of Shares will be made 
in cash and investors will not have any rights to receive delivery of the Index or any 
component included therein. 
 
The Index is calculated net of Index Embedded Costs, as described in the section 
General Description of the Underlying. These Index Embedded Costs, which may vary 
overtime, will indirectly impact the Fund’s performance. For the avoidance of doubt, 
these Index Embedded Costs are notional deductions made in the calculation of the 
Index Level and will not be paid from the Fund Assets.

The Investment Objective of the Fund is to reflect the performance of the Index - net of fees and 
expenses - which is designed to gain exposure to certain US economic sectors that are 
undervalued. The Fund will provide Shareholders with exposure to the Index through physical 
replication by investing directly in the Underlying components (i.e. Equity Shares) of the Index and 
as the case may be in unrelated transferable securities or other eligible assets. Further information 
 on the Index and the Underlying is contained in the “General Description of the Underlying” section.  
The Shareholders will receive the performance of the Index net of fees and expenses as further 
described under “Fees and Expenses” below. Therefore, the return Shareholders may receive 
may not wholly correspond to the performance of the Index, as more particularly described in the 
Prospectus. Additionally, the return Shareholders may receive may not correspond to the 
performance of the Index under certain exceptional circumstances such as disruptive market 
conditions (notably following the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, a Force Majeure Event, 
or a temporary suspension or interruption of trading in the components comprising the Index), 
 extremely volatile markets or liquidity or trading constraints.  
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the investment objective. The Fund is not 
 capital protected nor is it guaranteed. 
 Investment Policy and Fund Assets 
The Fund is passively managed. In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund will 
predominantly invest directly in Equity Shares based on the composition of the Index. The Fund 
may also seek exposure to Equity Shares indirectly and up to 10% of its Net Asset Value via 
investment in ETFs or equity-linked notes (i.e. unleveraged debt securities linked to the 
performance of equities) of companies listed or traded on a Regulated Market and in convertible 
 securities, which are convertible into, or exchangeable for, ordinary shares.  
The Investment Manager will create the portfolio of the Fund based on the composition of the Index. 
Please refer to the "General Description of the Underlying" section below for further detail in respect 
 of the Index Methodology.  
The Fund may also invest in currencies and FDIs for the purposes of currency hedging as further 
 described below, and may also hold ancillary cash positions.  
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor seeking exposure to the performance of the Index as further 
 described in the “General Description of the Underlying” section below. 
 Valuation 
The Administrator determines the Net Asset Value of the Fund as at the Valuation Point for each 
Dealing Day in accordance with the procedure provided for under the heading "Calculation of Net 
 Asset Value/Valuation of Assets" in the Prospectus. 
 Investment Restrictions 
The general investment restrictions set out under "Funds – Investment Restrictions" in the 
Prospectus apply to the Fund. 

 <Page260>  
 
260 
 
 
 The Fund may invest no more than 10% of its Net Asset Value in ETFs. 
 Tracking Difference/Tracking Error 
Investment in the Fund should not be considered to provide a direct investment in the Index, as the 
Fund gains exposure to the Index via Equity Shares. In normal market conditions, the Fund can be 
expected to track the performance of the Index (less fees and associated costs as further described 
under “Transaction Fees” and “Fees and Expenses” below). Any Tracking Error to the Index 
envisaged under normal market conditions is anticipated to be less than 2% per annum. Tracking 
Error for Share Classes denominated in currencies other than the currency of the Index may be 
 higher.  
Tracking Error should be differentiated from the tracking difference, which is simply the difference 
between the return of the Fund and the return of the Index, over a given period of time (the 
“Tracking Difference”). The Tracking Difference indicates the extent to which a Fund has 
outperformed or underperformed the Index. In contrast, the Tracking Error measures how 
consistently the Fund return tracks the Index. Hence, while the Tracking Difference shows how a 
Fund’s performance compares with that of the Index over a given period of time, the Tracking Error 
 indicates the consistency of the difference of return during this same period of time. 
 Leverage 
The Fund will not be leveraged for the purpose of investment. In accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations, the Fund's use of leverage will be calculated in line with the commitment 
approach and its global exposure through the use of FDIs will not exceed the total value of the 
  Fund’s assets.  
 The Fund will not borrow for investment purposes. 
 Subscriptions and Redemptions 
 The Fund will be open to subscriptions and redemptions on any Dealing Day.  
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
 will be done in cash or in specie in compliance with the Articles. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; and (c) dealing charges, taxes 
and other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and (d) 
 payments of any dividend. 
The Subscription Price or the Repurchase price of a Share may be adjusted as set out under the 
headings “Subscription Price” and Repurchase price” in the Prospectus. Where there is no dealing 
in the Fund or a specific Class of Share on the relevant Dealing Day, the Subscription Price or the 
Repurchase price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant Share Class 
 rounded off to such number of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
 Use of FDIs 
The Fund may use FDIs (including futures, forwards, options and/or Swaps) for efficient portfolio 
management purposes, as further detailed under “Currency Hedging”. 

 <Page261>  
 
261 
 
 
The Management Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with 
the CSSF. Any investment in FDIs will be made in accordance with this risk management 
policy. The Management Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative 
limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of 
 the main categories of investments. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 
The Fund may enter into OTC Derivatives (such as FX forwards) for the purposes of hedging the 
relevant Share Classes. It will do so pursuant to the terms of a 1992 or 2002 ISDA Master 
Agreement with an Approved Counterparty. The agreement will contain terms requiring the 
Approved Counterparty to provide collateral to the Company to reduce the Company’s risk 
exposure to the Approved Counterparty (as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus), as well as 
 standard events of default and termination events.  
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(iv) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good 
faith, make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets and/or 
any constituents thereof. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment; 
and/or 
 
(v) 
the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and 
any subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the 
provisions of the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net 
Asset Value”; and/or 
 
(vi) 
the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in 
the Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will be entitled to look solely to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and the Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 

 <Page262>  
 
262 
 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds of 
all claims of the Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the 
Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such 
claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically 
extinguished, (b) the Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof 
and (c) the Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company 
 as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
 Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. 
 Dividend Policy 
 There are no dividends in respect of any Class of Shares.

1In accordance with and subject to the terms of the Management Company Agreement, the annual 
Management Fees, represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value (plus VAT, if any) of the 
relevant Share Class, subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1,250 EUR per Fund. Management 
Fees are payable periodically at a rate which is within the range specified above. The Management 
Fee will be calculated upon each Dealing Day. Fees payable to the Investment Manager or 
Distributor (other than the Preliminary Charge) or Sub-Distributor, will be payable out of the 
Management Fee. The Management Company may instruct the Company to pay any such fees 
payable to the Investment Manager, or Distributor or Sub-Distributor, directly out of the assets of 
the Company. In such case, the portion of the Management Fee due to the Management Company 
will be reduced accordingly. Neither the Investment Manager nor the Distributor or Sub Distributor 
will be entitled to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their respective out-of-pocket 
 expenses. 
2 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share Class is payable by the Company for 
the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Management Fees, the Transaction Fees, 
Extraordinary Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. 
Additionally, the Fixed Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of 
 Luxembourg as disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”.  
When the Net Asset Value of the Fund is lower than USD 100 million, the Fixed Fee will be a 
 maximum of 0.20% p.a. 
When the Net Asset Value of the Fund is greater than or equal to USD 100 million, the Fixed Fee 
 will be a maximum of 0.15% p.a. 
For the avoidance of doubt, please note that Transaction Fees (as defined in the Prospectus) are 
 excluded from Fixed Fees. 

 <Page265>

 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees shall mean any costs in respect of buying and selling any of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, trading and administrative costs of entering into FDIs, transactional 
charges, collateral costs, brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads and licensing fees. 
The Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund will be calculated net of such costs, which may affect 
 the performance of the Fund.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING 
 
 
The Fund will seek to replicate the performance of the Index net of fees and expenses. The Index 
aims to incorporate the principles of long term investing distilled by Dr. Robert Shiller and provides 
an alternative to market capitalization weighted indices by gaining exposure to US economic 
sectors that are undervalued using the Relative CAPE® indicator, combining this with price 
 momentum to reduce the Index’s potential exposure to “value traps”. 
The Relative CAPE® indicator is a variant of the classic CAPE® ratio. The CAPE® (‘Cyclically 
Adjusted Price Earnings’ (CAPE®)) ratio is a variation of the traditional Price/Earnings ('PE') ratio 
that uses the ten year average of inflation-adjusted earnings instead of single year earnings. Assets 
with a lower CAPE® ratio are generally considered to be "undervalued", while assets with a higher 
 CAPE® ratio are generally considered to be "overvalued".  
The Index uses a modified version of the classic CAPE® ratio, called the “Relative 
CAPE® indicator”, in determining the index components for any given rebalancing period. The 
Relative CAPE® indicator is used instead of the classic CAPE® ratio in order to account for the 
fact that some sectors tend to consistently trade at lower classic CAPE® ratios while other sectors 
tend to consistently trade at higher classic CAPE® ratios over time.The Relative CAPE® indicator 
is a ratio of the current CAPE® ratio for a sector to its historical rolling twenty year average 
 CAPE® ratio. 
(A) 
Index Methodology 
 
 The Index systematically selects undervalued US economic sectors using the following method:  
First, the Index components selection starts with the calculation of the CAPE® ratio on the 10 US 
 economic sectors below: 
Utilities 
Consumer Staples 
Financials and Real Estate 
Materials 
Technology 
Healthcare 
Energy 
Consumer Discretionary 
Industrial 
Communication Services 
 
Then, the Relative CAPE® indicator is calculated for each of the above 10 US economic sectors. 
The 5 most undervalued sectors based on the Relative CAPE® indicator are selected. Out of them, 
the sector with the lowest 12-month return is removed to avoid value traps (i.e. this sector may be 
 cheap on a regular basis due to fundamental reasons and value might continue to decline).  
Last, the Index takes an equal weighted position in the 4 undervalued US economic sectors with 
 most positive 12-month returns. 
(B) 
Index Publication 
 
The Index Sponsor will make available the value of the Index in respect of each Index Business 
Day as soon as reasonably practicable on or after each such Index Business Day on the Index 
 Sponsor’s website: http://indices.barclays (or any successor thereto). 
The Index Sponsor will publish any adjustments made to the Index on the Index Sponsor’s website: 
 http://indices.barclays (or any successor thereto). 
The Index Sponsor will publish the Index Methoology Description on the Index Sponsor’s website: 

 <Page267>

 ndexIMD.pdf 
(C) 
Replicating portfolio 
 
The Fund will replicate the Index through physical replication by investing directly in Equity Shares 
comprised in the 4 relevant US economic sectors selected in the manner described above, or 
indirectly via investment in ETFs, equity-linked notes and convertible and/or exchangeable 
 securities representing such sectors, as notified by the Index Sponsor. 
The Investment Manager gains exposure to the Equity Shares on a best efforts basis and in its sole 
  and absolute discretion subject to applicable regulatory and/or operational limitations.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors  
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD READ AND 
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT IN THE PROSPECTUS AND THOSE SET OUT 
BELOW BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE FUND. THESE RISK FACTORS 
MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. In particular, 
no financial instrument enables the returns of the Index to be reproduced or tracked 
exactly. Changes in the investments of any Fund and re-weightings of the Index may 
give rise to various transaction costs (including in relation to the settlement of foreign 
currency transactions), operating expenses or inefficiencies which may adversely 
impact a Fund's tracking of the performance of the Index. Furthermore, the total return 
on investment will be reduced by certain costs and expenses which are not taken into 
account in the calculation of the Index. Moreover, in the event of a temporary 
suspension or interruption of trading in the investments comprising the Index, or of 
market disruptions, re-balancing the Fund's investment portfolio may not be possible 
and may result in deviations from the return of the Index. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors” sub-section “Use of Derivatives” 
in the Prospectus. 
 
(f) 
The value of the Index could be adversely affected by the promulgation of new laws or 
regulations or by the reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations (including, without 
limitation, those relating to taxes and duties on any equity index) by one or more 
governments, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, courts or other official 
bodies. Such changes may affect the value of the Fund Assets, and consequently of 
the Fund, and may lead to a Disruption Event. 
 
(g) 
Certain types of assets may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market conditions, 
and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(h) 
Potential conflicts of interest may exist in the internal teams and divisions within 
Barclays Bank PLC and therefore in the course of normal business operations of the 
Index Sponsor and other divisions and teams of Barclays Bank PLC and/or any of its 
affiliates. During the course of normal business operations, the Index Sponsor may 
determine, calculate and publish the Index, while another team within Barclays Bank 
PLC may issue, enter into, promote, offer or sell transactions or investments linked, in 
whole or in part, to the Index. In addition, another team within Barclays Bank PLC may 
have, or may have had, interests or positions, or may buy, sell or otherwise trade 
positions in or relating to the underlying assets linked to the Index. Such activities may 

 <Page269>  
 
269 
 
or may not have an impact on the level of the Index. In view of the different roles 
performed by Barclays Bank PLC through the various teams, Barclays Bank PLC as 
an entity is subject to potential conflicts of interests. 
 
(i) 
While the Index Sponsor currently employs the methodology ascribed to the Index (and 
application of such methodology shall be conclusive and binding), no assurance can 
be given that market, regulatory, juridical, financial, fiscal or other circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, any changes to or any suspension or termination of or 
any other events affecting any constituent within the Index) will not arise that would, in 
the view of the Index Sponsor, necessitate an adjustment, modification or change of 
such methodology. The Index Sponsor may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, at 
any time and without notice, adjust, suspend or terminate the Index. The Index Sponsor 
is also under no obligation to continue the calculation, publication and dissemination 
of the Index. Any such adjustment, suspension, termination or non-publication may 
have a negative impact on the Swaps and consequently, also on the Fund. 
 
The Index may have been only recently established and therefore may have no history 
to evaluate its likely performance. 
 
The Index is not intended to predict actual results and no assurances are given with 
respect thereto. 
 
The Index is subject to certain extraordinary and force majeure events, including, but 
not limited to, any modification to, or cancellation of, the Index or any elimination or 
exchange of any index component or constituent, the consequences of which may 
have a negative impact upon the performance of the Index. 
 
In the case of any ambiguities arising in the Index Rules, the Index Sponsor will resolve 
such ambiguities in good faith and in a reasonable manner and, if necessary, amend 
 the Index Rules to reflect such resolution. 
(j) 
The sub-funds of the Company are segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as 
such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the 
liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be noted that the Company is a single 
legal entity which may operate or have assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims 
in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily recognise such segregation. There can 
be no guarantee that the courts of any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the 
limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
(k) 
The Fund may seek to hedge the exchange rate translation risk for each Class of 
Shares not denominated in the Base Currency by notionally entering into an 
appropriate FX forward contract (the “FX Forward”). Should such hedging be 
undertaken, the notional amount of the FX Forward will be fixed at the beginning of 
each relevant FX Forward contract based on the latest available value of the Net Asset 
Value for the relevant Classes of Shares at such date. Any subsequent movement in 
the value of the Underlying will result in a portion of the exposure to the Underlying 
equal in value to that movement being unhedged against foreign exchange translation 
risk until the date on which the FX Forwards are rolled for the following period or until 
any subsequent trades are executed at the discretion of the Investment Manager. The 
value of the Shares may also be affected by fluctuations in value due to the change in 
 mark-to-market value of the FX Forwards. 
(l) 
The investment decisions of any underlying ETFs are made by their own investment 
managers or advisors; such investment decisions are independent from the Investment 
Manager’s investment decisions for the Fund. The Investment Manager does not take 
responsibility for the investment decisions made by the investment managers or 
advisors of any underlying ETFs.

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The Investment Objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with a return linked to the 
performance of the Index. Further information on the Index and the Underlying Futures is contained 
 under section “General Description of the Underlying” below. 
The Shareholders will receive the performance of the Index net of fees and expenses as further 
described under “Fees and Expenses” below and any return from a cash management portfolio of 
Money Market Instruments and/or fixed income instruments. Therefore, the return Shareholders 
may receive may not wholly correspond to the performance of the Index, as more particularly 
described in the Prospectus. Additionally, the return Shareholders may receive may not correspond 
to the performance of the Index under certain exceptional circumstances such as following the 
occurrence of a Disruption Event (for example, a temporary suspension or interruption of trading in 
 the components comprising the Index), extremely volatile markets or liquidity or trading constraints.  
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the investment objective. The Fund is not 
 capital protected nor is it guaranteed. 
 Investment Policy and Fund Assets 
The Fund is passively managed. In order to achieve the Investment Objective, the Fund will 
synthetically replicate the performance of the Index by investing in Fund Assets, including Funded 
and Unfunded Swaps on the Index with the Approved Counterparty. The Index is further described 
 under section “General Description of the Underlying” below.  
The Fund shall enter into such Swaps, Money Market Instruments and fixed income investments, 
as determined by the Investment Manager. Where the Fund enters into Unfunded Swaps, it may 
invest any remaining cash in Money Market Instruments and/or fixed income instruments. Swaps 
 entered into by the Fund are more fully described under section “Use of FDIs” below.  
The Fund may also invest in currencies and FDIs for the purposes of currency hedging as further 
 described below, and may also hold ancillary cash positions.  
 
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor seeking long term capital appreciation with a medium risk profile 
by seeking to capture intraday momentum trends in the US equity market as further described in 
 “General Description of the Underlying”. 
 Valuation 
The Administrator determines the Net Asset Value of the Fund as at the Valuation Point for each 
Dealing Day in accordance with the procedure provided for under the heading "Calculation of Net 
 Asset Value/Valuation of Assets" in the Prospectus. 
 Investment Restrictions 
The general investment restrictions set out under "Funds – Investment Restrictions" in the 
 Prospectus apply to the Fund. 
The Fund will not invest more than 10% of its net assets in units and/or shares of other UCITS, 
exchange traded funds or other Collective Investment Schemes. 

 <Page278>  
 
278 
 
 
 Tracking Difference/Tracking Error 
Investment in the Fund should not be considered to provide a direct investment in the Index, as the 
Fund gains exposure to the Index via a Swap. In normal market conditions, the Fund can be 
expected to track the performance of the Index (less fees and associated costs as further described 
under “Transaction Fees” and “Fees and Expenses” below), and any Tracking Error to the Index 
envisaged under normal market conditions is anticipated to be less than 2%. Tracking Error for 
 Share Classes denominated in currencies other than the currency of the Index may be higher. 
Tracking Error should be differentiated from the tracking difference, which is simply the difference 
between the return of the Fund and the return of the Index, over a given period of time (the 
“Tracking Difference”). The Tracking Difference indicates the extent to which a Fund has 
outperformed or underperformed the Index. In contrast, the Tracking Error measures how 
consistently the Fund return matches the Index. Hence, while the Tracking Difference shows how 
a Fund’s performance compares with that of the Index over a given period of time, the Tracking 
 Error indicates the consistency of the difference of return during this same period of time. 
 Leverage 
The Fund will not be leveraged for the purpose of investment. In accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations, the Fund's use of leverage will be calculated in line with the commitment 
approach and its global exposure through the use of FDIs will not exceed the total value of the 
  Fund’s assets.  
 The Fund will not borrow for investment purposes. 
 Subscriptions and Redemptions 
 The Fund will be open to subscriptions and redemptions on any Dealing Day. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
The Subscription Price and the Repurchase Price of a Share on a Dealing Day is the Net Asset 
Value per Share of the relevant Class on the relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with 
any applicable Preliminary Charge, Exchange Charge or Repurchase Charge (as set out in the 
table below) and in accordance with the provisions of this section. Subscriptions and redemptions 
 will be done in cash or in specie in compliance with the Articles. 
The Net Asset Value per Share Class will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the 
Fund Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; 
(b) accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; and (c) dealing charges, taxes 
and other similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and (d) 
 payments of any dividend. 
The Subscription Price or the Repurchase price of a Share may be adjusted as set out under the 
headings “Subscription Price and Repurchase Price” in the Prospectus. Where there is no dealing 
in the Fund or a specific Class of Share on the relevant Dealing Day, the Subscription Price or the 
Repurchase Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant Share Class 
 rounded off to such number of decimal places as the Directors deem appropriate. 
 Use of FDIs 
 The Fund may gain exposure to the Index through Funded and Unfunded Swaps.  
The Fund may also use FDIs for efficient portfolio management purposes, as further detailed under 
 “Currency Hedging” below. 

 <Page279>  
 
279 
 
The Approved Counterparty to the FDIs will be required to provide collateral to the Company so 
that the Company's risk exposure to the Approved Counterparty is reduced to the extent required 
by the Law and applicable regulations as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus. The cost 
associated with providing such collateral may be charged to the Fund by such Approved 
 Counterparty through the value of the FDI. 
FDIs will have a fixed maturity and may also be terminated early on the occurrence of certain events 
with respect to either the Fund or an Approved Counterparty including, but not limited to, an event 
of default (such as a failure to pay, breach of agreement or bankruptcy) or a termination event 
(which is not the fault of either party, for example, illegality or a tax event). In each case the FDI 
will be settled for an amount as set out in the contract. The Fund may then enter into new FDIs with 
 other Approved Counterparties in order to gain exposure to the financial asset classes. 
The Management Company on behalf of the Fund has filed its risk management policy with 
the CSSF. Any investment in FDIs will be made in accordance with this risk management 
policy. The Management Company will, on request, provide supplementary information to 
Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative 
limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of 
 the main categories of investments.  
Shareholder’s attention is drawn to the fact that, with the advice of the Investment Manager, 
 the Fund uses TRS in order to gain exposure to all or part of the Index.  
The expected and maximum proportion of the total assets which may be subject to Swaps is 
summarized in the table below. In certain circumstances this proportion may be higher. 
 
TRS 
Minimum level 
(in % of total 
assets) 
Expected level 
(in % of total 
assets) 
Maximum level (in 
% of total assets)
Funded TRS 
0% 
0% 
0% 
Unfunded TRS 
0% 
100% 
110% 
 
 Automatic Termination of the Fund 
Under the terms of the Swap agreements entered into by the Company on behalf of the Fund, the 
Approved Counterparty has the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate the Swap agreement on 
any Index Business Day. In such event, a notice of termination of the Fund will be sent to the Fund 
shareholders and the Fund will be terminated automatically within one month from the date of the 
notice of termination.  
In addition, if the Index Level of the Index falls to zero, the Swap on the Index will also be terminated. 
Upon such latter event, the Fund may be invested in Money Market Instruments and may also hold 
ancillary cash positions, whilst the Investment Manager seeks to identify a suitable replacement 
Swap. If no suitable replacement Swap can be found by the Investment Manager in order to achieve 
the Investment Objective of the Fund, a notice of termination of the Fund will be sent to the Fund 
shareholders and the Fund will be terminated automatically within one month from the date of the 
 notice of termination. 
 Efficient Portfolio Management 
 Currency Hedging 
The Fund intends to utilise FDIs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange or FX 
rates where Fund Assets are in currencies different to the currency of the respective Share Classes. 
All such FDIs will be attributable to a specific Share Class. Any FDI could expose the Fund to the 

 <Page280>  
 
280 
 
Approved Counterparty credit risk. The Investment Manager intends to hedge fully the exposure of 
 each Share Class, however over-hedged or under-hedged positions may arise. 
The Fund may enter into OTC Derivatives (such as FX forwards) for the purposes of hedging the 
relevant Share Classes. It will do so pursuant to the terms of a 1992 or 2002 ISDA Master 
Agreement with an Approved Counterparty. The agreement will contain terms requiring the 
Approved Counterparty to provide collateral to the Company to reduce the Company’s risk 
exposure to the Approved Counterparty (as more fully disclosed in the Prospectus), as well as 
 standard events of default and termination events.  
The Company may incur transaction costs in respect of entering into any currency hedging. Any 
fees or costs and any gains/losses of the hedging transactions will accrue solely to the relevant 
 Share Class. 
 Disruption Events 
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(vii) 
the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good 
faith, make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets and/or 
any constituents thereof. The Net Asset Value may be affected by such adjustment; 
and/or 
 
(viii) 
the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and 
any subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the 
provisions of the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net 
Asset Value”; and/or 
 
(ix) 
the Directors may, in certain circumstances and under the conditions as set out in 
the Prospectus, terminate the Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will be entitled to look solely to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realised net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
Each FDI may contain limited recourse provisions under which the recourse against the Company 
in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to such FDI are expressed to be limited to the 
Fund Assets, and the Approved Counterparty will have no recourse to any other assets of the 
Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and the payment of such sale proceeds of 
all claims of the Approved Counterparty relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the 
Company ranking pari passu with or senior to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such 
claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically 
extinguished, (b) the Approved Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof 
and (c) the Approved Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company 
 as a consequence of any such shortfall. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
  Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis.

1 For the avoidance of doubt, whilst no specific limitations on redemptions exist, investors should 
be aware of the Fund’s general ability to apply a 10% limitation on redemptions of shares on each 
Dealing Day (please see section “Limitations on Repurchases” of the Prospectus for a more 
 detailed explanation of the gating mechanism). 
2 The Board of Directors, in consultation with the Investment Manager, may, in its sole and absolute 
discretion, decide (i) to hard close this Share Class to any subscriptions when the capacity limit of 
the Index (i.e. its maximum size to be efficiently managed by the Index Sponsor) is reached, and 
(ii) to re-open the subscriptions in this Share Class when the capacity permits so. Decisions taken 
by the Board of Directors on the closure and re-opening may have immediate or non-immediate 
effect and may be effective for an unspecified period of time. Information on such decisions will be 
 available at the registered office of the Company.  
3 Classes of Shares D, D1, and D2 are reserved to initial subscriptions from initial seed investors 
only as approved by the Directors. These Classes of Shares will be closed to subscriptions 
following initial subscriptions from the initial seed investors and will reopen only at the discretion of 
  the Board of Directors.

1In accordance with and subject to the terms of the Management Company Agreement, the annual 
Management Fees, represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value (plus VAT, if any) of the 
relevant Share Class, subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1,250 EUR per Fund. Management 
Fees are payable periodically at a rate which is within the range specified above. The Management 
Fee will be calculated upon each Dealing Day. Fees payable to the Investment Manager or 
Distributor (other than the Preliminary Charge) or Sub-Distributor, will be payable out of the 
Management Fee. The Management Company may instruct the Company to pay any such fees 
payable to the Investment Manager, or Distributor or Sub-Distributor, directly out of the assets of 
the Company. In such case, the portion of the Management Fee due to the Management Company 
will be reduced accordingly. Neither the Investment Manager nor the Distributor or Sub Distributor 
will be entitled to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their respective out-of-pocket 
 expenses. 
2 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Share Class is payable by the Company for 
the Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in the 
Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Management Fees, the Transaction Fees, 
Extraordinary Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. 
Additionally, the Fixed Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg as disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of 
doubt, please note that Transaction Fees (as defined in the Prospectus) are excluded from Fixed 
 Fees. 
 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees shall mean any costs in respect of buying and selling any of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, trading and administrative costs of entering into FDIs, transactional 

 <Page284>  
 
284 
 
charges, collateral costs, brokerage charges, commissions, bid-offer spreads and licensing fees. 
The Net Asset Value per Share of the Fund will be calculated net of such costs, which may affect 
 the performance of the Fund. 
Where Swaps are utilized to gain exposure to the Index, the return of such Swaps will be calculated 
net of swap fees of 0.15% per annum payable to the Approved Counterparty. In addition, the Index 
Level is calculated net of embedded costs of 0.015% applied on the notional of Underlying Futures 
contracts bought or sold. Such fees will include any collateral charges incurred by the Approved 
Counterparty in collateralizing the exposure of the Fund as required by the Law. Under the terms 
of the Swap, certain circumstances may lead to increased cost of hedging for the Approved 
Counterparty. Should such increased costs be applicable, the value of the Swap and / or the fees 
payable under the Swap may need to be adjusted to reflect the increase in cost of hedging for the 
 Approved Counterparty or the Swap may be terminated.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNDERLYING 
 
 
The Fund will seek to synthetically replicate the performance of the Index net of fees and expenses. 
The Index aims to take advantage of intra-day momentum on the S&P 500 Index, by buying 
Underlying Futures contracts when the market trend is upwards and selling Underlying Futures 
 contracts when the market sells off. 
(A) 
Index Methodology Description 
 
The Index strategy is based on an empirical observation that the S&P 500 Index exhibits a positive 
autocorrelation in intra-day price movements during volatile market conditions, i.e. it generally 
continues trending in the same direction intra-day. In other periods, autocorrelation has been small 
 but remained positive on average.  
To take advantage of this observed pattern, the Index takes a long or short exposure in Underlying 
Futures contracts on an hourly basis, up to 5 times a day, each Index Business Day. The Index 
closes out the Underlying Futures contracts at the end of each Index Business Day. Hence there 
 is no rebalancing of the Index.  
The size of the Index exposure in Underlying Futures contracts depends on the return of the 
Underlying Futures from the close on the previous Index Business Day to a particular observation 
intraday, with a maximum exposure at +/- 100% (long 100% or short 100%) achieved if the 
performance of the Underlying Futures vary up or down by more than 3%. Additionally, the change 
in exposure from hour to hour is capped at 100%; for example, where the position in Underlying 
Futures is short 70% for a given hour, the exposure can be a maximum of long 30% for the next 
 hour.  
If the performance of the Underlying Futures vary up or down by less than 3%, the Index exposure 
adjusts proportionally with the performance and applying a multiplier of 100/3, i.e. if return is +1%, 
the Index will go long 33.3333x 1% or 33.3333% notional exposure on the Underlying Futures for 
 the next hour. 
(B) 
Index Publication 
 
The Index Sponsor will make available the value of the Index in respect of each Index Business 
Day as soon as reasonably practicable on or after each such Index Business Day on the Index 
 Sponsor’s website: http://indices.barclays (or any successor thereto). 
The Index Sponsor will publish the Index Methodology Description and any adjustments made to 
 the Index on the Index Sponsor’s website: https://indices.barclays/idmo/ (or any successor thereto). 
(C) 
Portfolio 
 
The Fund will enter into Funded and Unfunded Swaps, each with the Approved Counterparty, that 
 replicate the performance of the Index net of fees and expenses. 
Where the Fund enters into Unfunded Swaps, it may invest any remaining cash in Money Market 
Instruments or fixed income instruments. Such instruments will be rated, or issued by or deposited 
with an entity rated, at least “A-” by Standard and Poor’s or equivalent. Money Market Instruments 
include, but are not limited to, short term fixed and floating rate government bonds, deposits, 
commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Fund shall enter into such Swaps, Money Market 
 Instruments and fixed income investments as determined by the Investment Manager. 

 <Page286>  
 
286 
 
The Investment Manager reserves the unilateral right to modify the exposure to any component of 
the Fund portfolio in order to remain in compliance with the investment restrictions and/or regulatory 
obligations applicable to the Fund.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD READ AND 
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT IN THE PROSPECTUS AND THOSE SET OUT 
BELOW BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN THE FUND. THESE RISK FACTORS 
MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
 
 General Risks relation to Investment in the Fund 
(a) 
The value of investments may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than 
they originally invested. 
 
(b) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. In particular, 
no financial instrument enables the returns of the Index to be reproduced or tracked 
exactly. Changes in the investments of any Fund and re-weightings of the Index may 
give rise to various transaction costs (including in relation to the settlement of foreign 
currency transactions), operating expenses or inefficiencies which may adversely 
impact a Fund's tracking of the performance of the Index. Furthermore, the total return 
on investment will be reduced by certain costs and expenses which are not taken into 
account in the calculation of the Index. Moreover, in the event of a temporary 
suspension or interruption of trading in the investments comprising the Index, or of 
market disruptions, re-balancing the Fund's investment portfolio may not be possible 
and may result in deviations from the return of the Index. 
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” in the Prospectus. 
 
(e) 
Shareholders should note the section “Risk Factors” sub-section “Use of Derivatives” 
 in the Prospectus. 
(f) 
Certain types of assets may be illiquid, particularly during adverse market conditions, 
and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(g) 
The Fund is a sub-fund of the Company. The sub-funds of the Company are 
segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as such, in Luxembourg, the assets of 
one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the liabilities of another sub-fund. However, 
it should be noted that the Company is a single legal entity which may operate or have 
assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims in other jurisdictions which may not 
necessarily recognise such segregation. There can be no guarantee that the courts of 
any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the limitations on liability as set out 
 above. 
Market Risks 
 
(h) 
The Fund’s performance is related to the performance of the Fund Assets. The Fund 
is therefore exposed to general market movements and trends in money market, 
equities, emerging markets equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and 

 <Page288>  
 
288 
 
volatility, which are occasionally partially affected by irrational factors. Such factors 
may lead to a more significant and longer lasting decline in prices affecting the entire 
 market. 
(i) 
The value of the Index could be adversely affected by the promulgation of new laws or 
regulations or by the reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations (including, without 
limitation, those relating to taxes and duties on any equity index) by one or more 
governments, governmental agencies or instrumentalities, courts or other official 
bodies. Such changes may affect the value of the Fund Assets, and consequently of 
the Fund, and may lead to a Disruption Event. 
 
(j) 
The positive intraday autocorrelation in stocks may disappear in the future leading to 
flat or negative returns on the strategy. 
 
(k) 
While the strategy doesn’t hold any positions overnight, intraday positions in 
Underlying Futures are subject to gap risk on large intra-day reversals instead of 
trending behavior. 
 
FDI Risks 
 
(l) 
Exposure is achieved through an investment in the Swaps on the Index. Given the 
nature of the Swaps and the costs that may be involved in their utilisation, the value of 
the Swaps (which ultimately determine the return the Shareholders will receive) may 
not exactly track the value of the Index. Shareholders should thus be familiar with the 
risks associated with such an approach to investment. 
 
(m) 
Under the terms of the Swaps, the Approved Counterparty has discretion not to 
execute a request from the Company on behalf of the Fund to increase exposure under 
the Swaps, and therefore not to invest net proceeds of any issue of Shares (whether 
on the Launch Date or subsequently) into the Swaps. Under such circumstances, the 
Fund will not be able to gain exposure to the Index to the extent that such subscription 
proceeds are not invested in Swaps, until such time as the Approved Counterparty is 
able to accept further investments into the Swaps. 
 
(n) 
The Swaps may be terminated in accordance with their terms upon the occurrence of 
certain events with respect to either the Approved Counterparty or the Fund (including 
change in law, hedging disruption, increased cost of hedging, termination of or material 
change to the applicable rules to the Index, failure to pay, insolvency and the imposition 
of withholding tax on the payments due by either party). Upon such termination, the 
Fund or the Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment 
(regardless of which party may have caused such termination) based on the mark to 
market value of the Swaps at such time, as determined by the Approved Counterparty. 
 
(o) 
The value of the Swaps may be adjusted by the Approved Counterparty or the 
Calculation Agent in accordance with their terms, in response to disruption events 
affecting such Swaps or the Index; or in response to modification or termination of the 
Index. Whilst it is expected that such adjustments will be made in good faith and in a 
commercially reasonable manner, such adjustments may affect the value of Fund 
Assets, and consequently, the Net Asset Value of Shares. 
 
(p) 
The return payable under the Swaps may be subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank 
PLC as an Approved Counterparty. In addition, different business areas within the 
investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, will act as the Calculation Agent 
under the Swaps and Index Sponsor. Shareholders should note that not only will they 
be exposed to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC but also potential conflicts of 
interest in the performance of these functions by Barclays Bank PLC. In such 
circumstances, Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to use its reasonable endeavours 
to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to its respective obligations 

 <Page289>  
 
289 
 
and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the Company and the Shareholders are 
not unfairly prejudiced. The Directors believe that Barclays Bank PLC is suitable and 
 competent to perform such functions. 
 Risks associated with the Index 
(q) 
Potential conflicts of interest may exist in the internal teams and divisions within 
Barclays Bank PLC and therefore in the course of normal business operations of the 
Index Sponsor and other divisions and teams of Barclays Bank PLC and/or any of its 
affiliates. During the course of normal business operations, the Index Sponsor may 
determine, calculate and publish the Index, while another team within Barclays Bank 
PLC may issue, enter into, promote, offer or sell transactions or investments linked, in 
whole or in part, to the Index. In addition, another team within Barclays Bank PLC may 
have, or may have had, interests or positions, or may buy, sell or otherwise trade 
positions in or relating to the underlying assets linked to the Index. Such activities may 
or may not have an impact on the level of the Index. In view of the different roles 
performed by Barclays Bank PLC through the various teams, Barclays Bank PLC as 
an entity is subject to potential conflicts of interests. 
 
(r) 
While the Index Sponsor currently employs the methodology ascribed to the Index (and 
application of such methodology shall be conclusive and binding), no assurance can 
be given that market, regulatory, juridical, financial, fiscal or other circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, any changes to or any suspension or termination of or 
any other events affecting any constituent within the Index) will not arise that would, in 
the view of the Index Sponsor, necessitate an adjustment, modification or change of 
such methodology. The Index Sponsor may also, in its sole and absolute discretion, at 
any time and without notice, adjust, suspend or terminate the Index. The Index Sponsor 
is also under no obligation to continue the calculation, publication and dissemination 
of the Index. Any such adjustment, suspension, termination or non-publication may 
have a negative impact on the Swaps and consequently, also on the Fund. 
 
The Index may have been only recently established and therefore may have no history 
to evaluate its likely performance. 
 
The Index is not intended to predict actual results and no assurances are given with 
respect thereto. 
 
The Index is subject to certain extraordinary and force majeure events, including, but 
not limited to, any modification to, or cancellation of, the Index or any elimination or 
exchange of any index component or constituent, the consequences of which may 
have a negative impact upon the performance of the Index. 
 
In the case of any ambiguities arising in the Index Rules, the Index Sponsor will resolve 
such ambiguities in good faith and in a reasonable manner and, if necessary, amend 
 the Index Rules to reflect such resolution. 
As the investment exposure gained by the Fund is synthetic, the Fund will have no 
rights with respect to the underlying components comprised in the Index. Entering into 
financial derivative instruments such as the Swaps will not make the Fund a holder of, 
or give the Fund a direct investment position in, the Index or any component included 
therein. Any amounts payable under the Swaps will be made in cash and the Fund will 
not have any rights to receive delivery of any underlying or any component of the Index 
included therein. Similarly, an investment in the Fund will therefore not make the 
investor a holder of, or give an investor a direct investment position in, the Index or any 
component included therein. Any amounts payable in respect of Shares will be made 
in cash and investors will not have any rights to receive delivery of the Index or any 
 component included therein. 

 <Page290>  
 
290 
 
The Index is calculated net of trading costs, as described in the section Transaction 
Fees. These Index trading costs, which may vary overtime, will indirectly impact the 
Fund’s performance. For the avoidance of doubt, these Index trading costs are notional 
deductions made in the calculation of the Index Level and will not be paid from the 
Fund Assets. 
 
 Currency Hedging Risks 
(s) 
The Fund may seek to hedge the exchange rate translation risk for some Class of 
Shares not denominated in the Base Currency by notionally entering into an 
appropriate FX forward contract (the “FX Forward”). Should such hedging be 
undertaken, the notional amount of the FX Forward will be fixed at the beginning of 
each relevant FX Forward contract based on the latest available value of the Net Asset 
Value for the relevant Classes of Shares at such date. Any subsequent movement in 
the value of the underlying will result in a portion of the exposure to the Underlying 
equal in value to that movement being unhedged against foreign exchange translation 
risk until the date on which the FX Forwards are rolled for the following period or until 
any subsequent trades are executed at the discretion of the Investment Manager. The 
value of the Shares may also be affected by fluctuations in value due to the change in 
mark-to-market value of the FX Forwards.

compliant with article 9 of the Grand-Ducal Regulation of 8 February 2008, namely the S&P 500 
Index, the EuroStoxx 50 Index and the Hang Seng Index, each as further described in the “General 
 Description of the Underlying” section of this Supplement;

TERMS OF THE SHARES REPRESENTING INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
 
 
 Investment Objective 
The investment objective of the Fund is to provide Shareholders with exposure to a structured 
payout strategy (the “Strategy”). The Strategy aims to generate a dividend paid quarterly and a 
final payout (the “Strategy Payout”) linked to the performance of the Underlying Indices over an 
investment period of up to eight (8) calendar quarters (the “Strategy Investment Period”). Based 
on the terms of the Strategy and the performance of the Indices during the Strategy Investment 
Period, the Strategy, and consequently the Fund, may terminate earlier than the Scheduled Maturity 
 Date, as further described below. 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve the investment objective. The Fund is neither 
 capital protected nor guaranteed. 
 Investment Policy 
The Fund is passively managed. In order to achieve the investment objective, the Company on 
behalf of the Fund intends to invest a substantial portion of the net proceeds of any issue of Shares 
on the Launch Date in a single over-the-counter Funded Swap with the Approved Counterparty 
(the “Funded Swap”) providing option-based exposure to the performance to the Underlying 
Indices. The remaining portion of the Net Asset Value of the Fund will pay for the ongoing charges 
of the Fund. After the Launch Date, the Fund shall not invest in any financial instruments other than 
 the one mentioned above. 
The Approved Counterparty and the Company on behalf of the Fund have entered into an ISDA 
Master Agreement (and related Credit Support Annex) for the purpose of the Funded Swap (the 
“Funded Swap Agreement”) whereby the Fund will transfer a substantial portion of the proceeds 
from the issuance of its Shares to the Approved Counterparty in exchange for the Approved 
Counterparty paying a return linked to the Underlying Indices. The Approved Counterparty will be 
required under the terms of the Funded Swap Agreement to provide collateral to the Company (in 
acceptable form, as explained below) so that the Company's risk exposure for and on behalf of the 
Fund to the Approved Counterparty is fully collateralised in accordance with and subject to the 
provisions of the Funded Swap Agreement.. The necessary collateral will be composed of 
 government bonds rated at least AA-.  
The Fund intends to sell the requisite portion of the Funded Swap only and exclusively if the Fund 
receives requests from Shareholders for repurchase of their Shares or if the Fund matures (or early 
 matures). 
The Funded Swap together with ancillary cash held by the Fund shall constitute the "Fund Assets" 
 for the purposes of the Prospectus. 
Further information relevant to the Fund’s investment policy is contained in the main part of the 
         Prospectus under “Investment Objectives and Policies” and under “Investment Restrictions”. 

 <Page299>

The diagram below shows how the Funded Swap works:  
 
 
 
 Strategy Payout mechanism 
Shareholders who are invested in the Fund during the Strategy Investment Period and who do not 
redeem their shares prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date will be entitled to receive the relevant 
Strategy Payout per Share (as described below). However, Shareholders who redeem prior to the 
Scheduled Maturity Date will receive the Net Asset Value of their Shares as at the relevant Dealing 
Day, which may be less than the amount invested and may be less than the amount that would be 
received if such Shareholder were to remain invested until an Autocall Maturity Date or the 
 Scheduled Maturity Date. 
While being invested in the Fund, Shareholders will first receive a dividend equivalent to USD 0.125 
per Share paid quarterly (as further described in section “Dividend Policy” below) until the Fund 
 matures either on an Autocall Maturity Date or on the Scheduled Maturity Date.  
 In addition, Shareholders shall receive one of the following Strategy Payout:  
1. If an Autocall Event occurs on any Quarterly Observation Date including the Scheduled 
Maturity Date, then the Fund matures and Shareholders receive a Strategy Payout equal to ten 
 US dollar (USD 10) per outstanding Share; 
2. If there is no Autocall Event and no Knock-In Event during the Strategy Investment Period, 
then the Fund matures on the Scheduled Maturity Date and Shareholders receive a Strategy 
Payout equal to ten US dollar (USD 10) per outstanding Share; 
 
3. If there is no Autocall Event but a Knock-In Event has occurred, the Fund will mature on 
the Scheduled Maturity Date and Shareholders receive an amount per outstanding Share equal 
to ten US dollar (USD 10) multiplied by the performance of the Worst Performing Index on the 
Scheduled Maturity Date. 
Shareholders will receive the Strategy Payout, and any residual cash held by the Fund following 
   the Autocall Maturity Date or Scheduled Maturity Date as the case may be.

Prospective investors should note that the upside of the Strategy Payout is limited by a 
fixed amount while the downside would match the downside of the Worst Performing Index 
should such Worst Performing Index level be observed below the Knock-In Level on any 
 day during the Strategy Investment Period. 
 Profile of a Typical Investor 
The Fund is suitable for an investor who can hold his investment for the medium term and who is 
 prepared to have a medium to high risk investment in its portfolio until the Scheduled Maturity Date. 
An investment in the Fund should not constitute a substantial proportion of an investment 
 portfolio and may not be appropriate for all investors. 
 Subscription Price and Repurchase Price 
Subscription of Shares in the Fund may only be accepted during the Initial Offer Period. Past the 
Initial Offer Period, any subscription of Shares will be rejected. During the Initial Offer Period, the 
 Initial Issue Price per Share will amount to USD 10.  
Shares may be redeemed on any Dealing Day. The Repurchase Price at which a Share will be 
repurchased, as the case may be, on a Dealing Day, is the Net Asset Value per Share on the 
relevant Dealing Day, as adjusted in accordance with any applicable Repurchase Charge and in 
 accordance with the provisions of this section. 
The Fund Assets will be valued at the Valuation Point on each Dealing Day (each as defined under 
“Terms of the Shares Representing Interests in the Fund – General Information Relating to the 
Fund”) in order to determine the Net Asset Value per Share in accordance with the rules set out in 
 the Prospectus. 
The Net Asset Value per Share will differ on each Dealing Day due to: (a) the value of the Fund 
Assets increasing or decreasing over time by reference to the performance of the Underlying; (b) 
accrual of fees and expenses in relation to the Fund over time; (c) dealing charges, taxes and other 
similar costs and spreads from buying and selling prices of the Fund Assets; and (d) payment of 

 <Page301>  
 
301 
 
 any dividends.  
The Net Asset Value per Share for repurchase may be respectively adjusted in accordance with 
the Anti-Dilution Levy as defined in the Prospectus. Where there is no redemption of Shares in the 
Fund on the relevant Dealing Day, the Repurchase Price will be the unadjusted Net Asset Value 
per Share rounded downwards to such number of decimal places as the Directors deem 
 appropriate. 
Accordingly, you should note that the Net Asset Value per Share in respect of a repurchase 
of Shares at any time may be less than the original value of your investment under certain 
 circumstances, and you should be prepared to sustain a loss on your investment. 
 Disruption Events  
Upon the occurrence of a Disruption Event (and without limitation to the Directors' general powers 
 as further described in the Prospectus): 
(iv) the Directors may, with the approval of the Depositary and with care and in good faith, 
make adjustments to determine the value of any of the Fund Assets. The Net Asset 
Value may be affected by such adjustment; and/or 
 
(v) the Directors may temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value and any 
subscription, repurchase and exchange of Shares in accordance with the provisions of 
the Prospectus under the section “Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value” and/or 
 
(vi) the Directors may, in certain circumstances as set out in the Prospectus, terminate the 
Fund. 
 
 Limited Recourse 
A Shareholder will solely be entitled to look to the Fund Assets in respect of all payments in respect 
of its Shares. If the realized net assets of the Fund are insufficient to pay any amounts payable in 
respect of the Shares, the Shareholder will have no further right of payment in respect of such 
Shares nor any claim against or recourse to any of the assets of any other Fund or any other asset 
 of the Company. 
The Funded Swap Agreement contains limited recourse provisions under which the recourse 
against the Company in respect of any claims arising under or in relation to the Derivative Contract 
are expressed to be limited to the Fund Assets, and the Approved Counterparty will have no 
recourse to any other assets of the Company. If following the realisation of the Fund Assets and 
the application of such realisation proceeds in payment of all claims of the Approved Counterparty 
relating to the Fund and all other liabilities (if any) of the Company ranking pari passu with or senior 
to such claims which have recourse to the Fund, such claims are not paid in full, (a) the amount 
outstanding in respect of such claims will be automatically extinguished, (b) the Approved 
Counterparty will have no further right of payment in respect thereof and (c) the Approved 
Counterparty will not be able to petition for the winding-up of the Company as a consequence of 
 any such shortfall. 
 Borrowings 
In accordance with the general provisions set out in the Prospectus under the heading "Funds - 
Borrowing and Lending Powers", the Company on behalf of the Fund may borrow up to 10% of the 
 Net Asset Value of the Fund on a temporary basis. 
 Leverage 
The Fund will not be leveraged for the purpose of investment. In accordance with the Law and 
applicable regulations, the Fund's use of leverage will be calculated in line with the commitment 

 <Page302>  
 
302 
 
approach and its global exposure through the use of FDIs will not exceed the total value of the 
 Fund’s assets. The Fund will not borrow for investment purposes. 
 Dividend Policy 
The Fund will pay a dividend amounting to USD 0.125 per Share in respect of Shares held on a 
Dealing Day up to and including the Dealing Day prior to such Ex-Dividend Date. Existing investors 
redeeming Shares on a Dealing Day on or after the Ex-Dividend Date will be entitled to the 
 dividends declared for that relevant period.  
One of the economic consequences of the payment of a dividend is that the Net Asset Value of the 
Shares will be reduced accordingly. Dividends will be paid in accordance with the terms of the 
 Prospectus. Dividends may be paid out of income and capital.

 Fees and Expenses 
The following fees and expenses will be incurred by the Company on behalf of the Fund and will 
affect the Net Asset Value of the Fund. 
 
Class of Shares 
"A" 
Management Fee1  
Up to 0.15% of the Net Asset Value of the Class of Shares per annum  
Upfront Fee2  
Up to 1.5% of the Initial Issue Price 
Fixed Fees3 
Up to 0.15% of the Net Asset Value of the Class of Shares per annum 
 
1 The Management Fee, which represents a percentage of the Net Asset Value of Class of Shares 
A (plus VAT, if any) is subject to a minimum monthly flat fee of 1.250 EUR per Fund. The 
Management Fee is payable by the Company out of the assets of the Fund to the Management 
Company. The Management Fee will accrue on each day and be calculated on each Dealing 
 Day and paid quarterly.  
2 Shareholders should note that the Upfront Fee will be charged at the inception of the Fund. This 
means that Shareholders who request the redemption of all or part of their Shares prior to the 
Scheduled Maturity Date will receive a Redemption Price that will already take into account such 
 Upfront Fee.  
The fees of the Investment Manager, Distributor or any third party will be payable out of the 
Management Fee and Upfront Fee and not out of the assets of the Fund, save as prescribed by 
sub-section “Management Fee” of section “Fees and Expenses” of the Prospectus. Neither the 
Management Company, the Investment Manager, the Distributor, or any third party will be entitled 
 to be reimbursed out of the assets of the Fund for their respective out-of-pocket expenses. 
3 A percentage of the Net Asset Value of Class of Shares A is payable by the Company for the 
Fund as Fixed Fees and is in respect of the ordinary fees, expenses and costs incurred by the 
Fund including the Administrator’s fees, the Depositary’s fees and other expenses as set out in 
the Prospectus. The Fixed Fee expressly excludes the Management Fees, Extraordinary 
Expenses, and any costs in respect of any termination of the Fund. Additionally, the Fixed 
Fees do not include the Taxe d’Abonnement payable to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as 
disclosed in the Prospectus under the heading "Taxation”. For the avoidance of doubt, please 
 note that Transaction Fees (as defined in the Prospectus) are excluded from Fixed Fees.  
 Transaction Fees 
Transaction Fees shall mean any costs in respect of buying and selling any of the Fund Assets, 
including, but not limited to, administrative costs of entering into the Funded Swap, transactional 

 <Page304>  
 
304 
 
charges, collateral costs, commissions, and licensing fees. The Net Asset Value per Share of the 
Fund will be calculated net of such costs, which may affect the performance of the Fund. In 
normal market conditions, Barclays Bank PLC as the Approved Counterparty is expected to apply 
a dealing fee of up to 0.5% on the value of every downsize of the Funded Swap following any 
Shareholder request for redemption. In the absence of normal market conditions and for large 
downsizes of the Funded Swap, higher dealing fees may apply.

OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 
 Risk Factors 
Certain risks relating to the Shares are set out under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Prospectus. 
 In addition, Shareholders should note that: 
AN INVESTMENT IN THE SHARES OF THE FUND IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A 
DEGREE OF RISK. ACCORDINGLY, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER THE 
FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS. THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF 
 ALL RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND. 
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF THE FUND IS TO PROVIDE THE INVESTORS WITH A 
 RETURN LINKED TO THE FUNDED SWAP.  
(a) 
There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
 
(b) 
There can be no assurance that an investor will achieve profits or avoid losses, 
significant or otherwise. Neither the income, the return nor the capital of the Fund is 
guaranteed. The value of investments and the income derived from such investments 
may fall as well as rise. There are risks that investors may not recoup the original 
amount invested in the Fund during the investment period as well as at the Scheduled 
Maturity Date. Investment in the Fund may decline in value and investors should be 
prepared to sustain a substantial or total loss of their investment particularly if a Knock-
In Event has occurred.  
 
(c) 
The return on the Shares may be less than that of other securities of comparable 
maturity or less than interest rates available in the market. 
 
(d) 
An Upfront Fee will be charged at inception of the Fund and therefore, the Net Asset 
Value per Share will drop, on the first day after Launch Date, by the level of the Upfront 
Fee. Repurchase price will reflect this drop in the Net Asset Value per Share if a 
Shareholder redeems before the maturity of the Fund. 
 
(e) 
The maximum potential gain of the Fund is limited to the sum of the dividends that may 
be paid over the life of the Fund. An investment in the Fund can underperform an 
investment in the Underlying Indices and Shareholders will not benefit from any 
potential upside of the Underlying Indices.  
 
(f) 
Repayment of principal on an Autocall Maturity Date, if an Autocall Event occurs, 
creates reinvestment risk. There is uncertainty on other opportunities available for 
investment at such time, thus resulting in lower potential returns if the Fund matures 
early. 
(g) 
Shareholders should note the sections “Risk Factors – Specific risks relating to Funds 
whose performance is linked to an Underlying” and “Risk Factors – Use of Derivatives” 
in the Prospectus. 
 
(h) 
The Funded Swap Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms upon 
the occurrence of one or several Swap Disruption Events. Upon such termination, the 
Fund or the Approved Counterparty may be liable to make a termination payment 
(regardless of which party may have caused such termination) based on the mark to 
market value of the Funded Swap at such time, as determined by the Approved 
Counterparty.

(i) 
The return payable under the Funded Swap is subject to the credit risk of Barclays 
Bank PLC as Approved Counterparty and is fully collateralised in accordance with and 
subject to the provisions of the Funded Swap Agreement. In addition, Barclays Bank 
PLC, or any successor entity to which the index products team of Barclays Bank PLC 
may be transferred which is acceptable to the Investment Manager, may act as the 
calculation agent and/or index sponsor for proprietary indices to which the Underlying 
Indices may be allocated. Shareholders should note that in such case not only will they 
be exposed to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC but also to potential conflicts of 
interest in the performance of these functions by Barclays Bank PLC. In such 
circumstances, Barclays Bank PLC has undertaken to use its reasonable endeavours 
to resolve any such conflicts of interest fairly (having regard to its respective obligations 
and duties) and to ensure that the interests of the Company and the Shareholders are 
not unfairly prejudiced. The Directors believe that Barclays Bank PLC is suitable and 
competent to perform such functions. 
 
(j) 
Certain types of assets such as Derivative Contracts may be illiquid, particularly during 
adverse market conditions, and this may indirectly affect the Net Asset Value per Share. 
 
(k) 
The sub-funds of the Company are segregated as a matter of Luxembourg law and as 
such, in Luxembourg, the assets of one sub-fund will not be available to satisfy the 
liabilities of another sub-fund. However, it should be noted that the Company is a single 
legal entity which may operate or have assets held on its behalf or be subject to claims 
in other jurisdictions which may not necessarily recognise such segregation. There can 
be no guarantee that the courts of any jurisdiction outside Luxembourg will respect the 
limitations on liability as set out above. 
 
(l) 
The Fund may be liquidated on the occurrence of certain events specified in the 
Prospectus. Investors should note that, the amount distributed to them upon liquidation 
may be less than the amount of their principal.
